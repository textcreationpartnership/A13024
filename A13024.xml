            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſo much the more do I preſume thus to do becauſe you are not nobly deſended onely according to the fleſh, but alſo becauſe you come of a ſtocke as noble for religion and the profeſſion of the Goſpell. For of my knowledge you are now the fourth of that Honorable houſe in a right line that haue bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the Churches for profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and fauour vnto the profeſſiors and Miniſters
<pb facs="tcp:210:8"/> thereof. Your Honorable great Grand-father main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his houſe learned Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> afterward called from thence to be Preacher at <hi>Iſpwich</hi> in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke:</hi> &amp; then from thence remoued to <hi>Dinnington,</hi> where yet (I hope) he remaineth, a graue reuerend and vigilant paſtour. My ſelfe alſo once being at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> about ſome 43 yeares paſt, when Doct. <hi>Some</hi> was to preach before moſt renowned Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of moſt bleſſed memorie, did there ſee your ſaid Noble great Grand-father, in his humilitie to be as carefull (yea alſo painefull) to ſee all things in pulpit to be fit for him, as if he had beene ſome inferour officer in the chappell to haue looked vnto ſuch things. Of your late Noble Grand-father the memoriall was and is moſt ſweet and precious, and will neuer die. Of your moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Father I haue ſaid ynough before in this my epiſtle dedicatorie to him and your ſelfe. Heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may not be forgotten the moſt virtuous and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Counteſſe and Ladie your Mother, of pietie and modeſtie a moſt worthy patterne to all other Noble women of like ſort.</p>
            <p>How good alſo is the Lord vnto you in your chriſtian education and inſtruction vnder Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> the godly and painefull paſtour of <hi>Braintree,</hi> as it were <hi>at the feete of Gamaliel?</hi> In which reſpect it<note place="margin">Act. 22. 3.</note> may be ſaid of you as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth of <hi>Timothie, that</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 14. 15</note> 
               <hi>you from your childhood haue learned and knowne the holy Scripture.</hi> Therefore alſo all that know theſe things may the better hope the like of you, that <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth of <hi>Timothie</hi> touching the faith of his Grand-mother and Mother, yea in a degree higher
<pb facs="tcp:210:8"/> viz <hi>that the faith which dwelt firſt in your</hi> Honorable<note place="margin">2.

So alſo you are a greater heire then of an earthly Earledome, euen of the<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> Kingdome of heauen: and heire together with <hi>Chriſt Ieſus of an heauenly inheritance, immortall &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 4.</note> And for your preſeruation vnto this inheritance, the Angels not onely pitch their tents <hi>round about</hi>

               <hi>you, but God himſelfe alſo guardeth you with his power, and compaſſeth you about with his fauour.</hi> God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being greater then all, you may no more doubt of your preſeruation to the foreſaid heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and Kingdome, then you may doubt of the power of God. As you are heire apparant to an Earle, and may hereafter be an Earle, you haue men to attend vpon you: but as you are ſuch as before I ſaid, you haue the glorious Angels of heauen to waite on you, <hi>and to beare you in their hands &amp;c.</hi> In the<note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 11. 12.</note> reſurrection you ſhall not onely be as the <hi>Angels of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note> 
               <hi>God in heauen, but you ſhall be alſo like vnto Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe: being where Chriſt Ieſus is, and beholding the glorie of God &amp;c.</hi> O Right Honorable, were <hi>Peter Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſo rauiſhed with the ſight of Chriſt<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 4.</note> Ieſus his tranſfiguration onely for a time, that they prayed him they might neuer depart from that mountaine wher they ſaw him ſo tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſfigured: How therefore ought your Noble heart to be rauiſhed with the certaintie of the euerlaſting promiſes?
<pb facs="tcp:210:9"/> Therefore alſo reioyce more in theſe things, then in all your earthly honors whatſoeuer. And as the Lord hath thus highly honored you, ſo labour you (I beſeech you) to honor him accordingly: not ſo much conſidering what benefits <hi>you haue receiued from him</hi> for this life, and for the life to come, as deliberating with your ſelfe <hi>what to render vnto him</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 12.

Let not your tender yeares preiudice your conſideration of theſe things. For in this treatiſe you ſhall afterward ſee, that men may too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the ſacrificing of themſelues vnto God, but they cannot begin to ſoone. And indeed what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect can begin too ſoone to ſerue ſuch a ſoueraigne as will entertaine him into any ſpeciall ſeruice? That you may ſo do, beware (I beſeech you) of flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: beware of euill councell to the contrarie: both

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued,</hi> I am not ignorant of two other treatiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready publiſhed, in Title ſomewhat like to this of mine following: the one only tranſlated into Engliſh, and compiled by another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a name expreſſed. The other being the worke of a godly brother amongſt vs, Maſter <hi>Thomas Cooper.</hi> Notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe neither the one nor the other, either in matter or in forme doe agree with this of mine, therefore as I feare no diſgrace to mine by theirs, ſo I wiſh no preiudice to theirs by mine. The godly minded reader may well make vſe both of theirs and of mine. Yet this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſgrace to either of theirs I may ſafely ſay, that hereinmine differeth from theirs, both in handling a ſpeciall place of Scripture, and alſo that in the interpretation of the ſaid Scripture, I diſcuſſe diuers points of doctrine, making ſuch particular application of them, as the times require. Now whereas in this treatiſe vpon the ſecond verſe, I write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what largely, and it may be in ſome mens conceite, ſomewhat ſharpely againſt conformitie to this worlde I deſire ſuch as ſhall ſo thinke to conſider that the more generall the fault is, as well of them that would be accounted louers of the Goſpell, as of them that are open contemners and ſcorners thereof, therefore alſo it is the more dangerous, and for curing thereof requireth the more ſharpe reprehenſions. The bitterer any potion is, the
<pb facs="tcp:210:12"/> more any ointment or plaiſter ſmarteth, the more effectually for the moſt part ſuch portions and ointments and plaiſters doe worke in or vpon them to whom they are adminiſtred. Such alſo as ſhall ſo iudge of my writing I entreate further to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how ſharpely the Prophets haue enveyed, and how fearefull iudgements of the Lord they haue thundred out againſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note place="margin">Iſay. 3 13. Zeph. 1. 8.</note> in this kind. The Prophets indeed were imediatly ſent and commanded of God to ſpeake that which they ſpake. But why? Becauſe the ordinarie Prieſts and Levites, either did not that which they ſhould haue done, or were not regarded in doing thereof. This therefore is no iuſt exception againſt the Miniſters declaming and exclaming againſt this ſin in theſe dayes: neither is it any excuſe at all for any ſo ſinning. The grace of God in the Goſpell doth not tolerate but agrauate ſuch things. Notwithſtanding I doe not alike condemne all perſons in like ſort offending: but the ſin it ſelfe I condemne alike in all. Some infected with this diſeaſe of the faſhions I grant do diligently heare the word: yea riſe earely (though of great place and ſtate) to go ſome miles to heare the word; and do often heare it againſt ſuch faſhions, and yet reforme not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therein, what then? Shall I iudge them ſo to come ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhew themſelues, then for loue of the word? I dare not be ſo vncharitable. I know better things by ſome of them, and ſuch as accompanie ſaluation. God openeth not the eyes of all<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 9. Mark. 8. 24.</note> to ſee all at once. I do not therefore ſo much wonder thereat, as hope and pray they may ſtill come, that ſo at the laſt they may heare that, whereby they may be conuerted and reformed. <hi>The wordes of the wiſe are as goades and nailes &amp;c.</hi> The<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 11.</note> The more therefore any are pricked with ſuch goades, the more they will be quickened: the oftener ſuch nailes are ſmitten, the deeper they will peirce.

            <p>The women indeed that in theſe daies are ſo ſhameles as to poule their heads, (ſo likewiſe changing their ſex; and oppoſing themſelues to the expreſſe word of God, are alſo moſt hopeleſſe. Yet if any of them ſhall come to the word, though nothing leſſe minded then to profit by the word, they may for all that be

            <p>That which afterward I haue written for the reuerence and maintainance of the Miniſters of the Goſpell, I haue not without griefe written, to ſee the great contempt and ſtrange neglect of ſuch Miniſters, as are both in their miniſtrie moſt faithfull and laborious, and for their life and conuerſation moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable. For doth not many a man of any great abilitie, and kind diſpoſition, better reſpect a ſeruant that hath beene with him ſome yeeres, and faithfully alſo ſerued him during the ſaid time, then many that would be taken great profeſſors, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their Miniſters, though neuer ſo long and painefully preaching vnto them? Do not alſo ſuch perſons by ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment more bountifully reward ſuch ſeruants at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them, then ſuch people do reward ſuch Miniſters, euen whilſt they are with them? And may not ſuch iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God be feared againſt the whole land for this ſinne as heeretofore haue bin executed vpon other people for the like? The ſame I ſay for that which I haue written of the itching eares of ſome to heare other preachers farther off dwelling, with neglect of their owne, and neerer dwellers, though they cannot iuſtly except any thing againſt them: yea I haue written the more in this behalfe, not onely becauſe of the great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch their owne and other neere dwelling Miniſters, but alſo becauſe ſomtime ſuch itching ears vpon a light report of ſome ſtranger preaching 3 or 4 miles off on the Lordes day going to heare him, &amp; haue loſt their labour, heard no Sermon at all.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding which I haue written of hearing the next dwelling Preachers after their owne, rather then further dwellers, I doe not meane of Preachers in the ſame Cittie or Towne that hath diuers Churches, becauſe in ſuch places far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwellers may be heard after their owne Preachers without any great labour of the hearer, and without any preiudice to
<pb facs="tcp:210:13"/> neerer dwellers. In ſuch places more libertie may be vſed, then where further dwellers cannot be heard without more labour, then is fit to be taken on the Lords day.</p>
            <p>Neither alſo do I ſo condemne all hearing of further dwellers (mens owne or neere dwelling Preachers not being neglected) but that in ſome extraordinarie cauſes, and at ſometimes, for comfort of afflicted conſciences, or for reſolution of ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mindes in ſome things, men may heare ſome furthers dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whom they ſhall vnderſtand either to preach of ſuch a text as may miniſter moſt comfort to ſuch troubles of conſcience, or to handle ſuch points as are eſpecially doubted of: Prouided not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it be no ordinarie matter, neither often but ſeldome.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I haue heere promiſed to preuent all miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any thing in this treatiſe by me written: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to auoid all offence by ſuch miſconſtruction. If any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſhall ſeeme ſtrange, I hope that loue and iudgement ſhall qualifie the ſtrangneſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Loth I am, and very loath to offend any of Gods children. But touching ſuch as are ſo curious that nothing will pleaſe them: and that rather read mens workes to carpe at them then to profit by them: ſeeming alwaies <hi>to learne and yet</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all the former part of this Epiſtle, the Apoſtle after the teſtification of his loue vnto theſe <hi>Chriſtian Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> by his gracious ſalutation of them, and holy thankſgiuing vnto God in their behalfe, as alſo by his earneſt prayers for them, hath chiefly and principally laboured
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:210:14"/> in deliuering certaine maine and fundamentall points of Religion; yet not ſo wholy and altogether, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he inſerteth ſome exhortations, according to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offered by the particular doctrines handled by him.</p>
               <p>The points of doctrine before deliuered, are eſpecially<note place="margin">The points of doctrine han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in all the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> theſe: Firſt, the corruption of all men, Iewes and Gentiles by nature, in tranſgreſſing the law of God, together with the wrath of God deſerued thereby, in the latter part of the firſt Chapter, and ſo forward to the end of the ſecond; ſhewing notwithſtanding by the way, that the Iewes were deeper in that corruption then the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reſpect of their greater knowledge; and that yet God had bin very patient and long-ſuffering towards them, thereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to leade them to repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, proleptically to preuent an obiection he ſheweth that their greater ſinne did not preiudice their prerogatiue aboue the Gentiles, by the word of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vouchſafed vnto them, and to no other nation; and ſo preuenting ſome other obiections to make way to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of iuſtification by faith alone, without the works of the law either ceremoniall or morall, performed by meere naturall men, or in part ſanctified by grace; he handleth this point largely in the third and fourth Chapters, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying the ſame by diuers effects and fruites thereof, and declaring the grace of God therein to be the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God vouchſafed the ſame, when they that were ſo iuſtified by him, were his enemies, &amp;c. Chap. 5.</p>
               <p>In the ſixt Chapter he hath ſhewed the ſaid grace of God in ſo iuſtifying men, not to giue libertie to men to ſinne, but to bind men to make the more vſe of the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, to the dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vnto righteouſneſſe; and giuing their members as plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as truly and as cheerfully vnto righteouſnes, as euer before they had giuen them vnto ſinne and vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>In the ſeuenth Chapter he ſheweth in what maner we that now liue vnder the Goſpell are freed from the Law,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:210:14"/> and how we are dead vnto the Law, and yet that the Law is ſtill neceſſary to ſhew vs our corruption, remaining in the beſt, and being ſo forcible that many times it maketh them to do that that they ſhould not, and the which by grace they would not doe: ſo that euen the very beſt (though as holy as <hi>Paul</hi>) may crie out of their miſerable eſtate in that reſpect, and yet the more giue thanks to God for their deliuerance from the ſame by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the eight Chapter he inſiſteth in the former priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them that are deliuered by Ieſus Chriſt from their miſerable condition by ſinne remaining in them, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not onely that all that are in Chriſt Ieſus are freed from condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and who they be that ſo are in Chriſt Ieſus, but alſo that they are by the ſame Ieſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted to be the children of God and heires of God with Chriſt, and endued with the Spirit of God, whereby not to feare, but boldly to pray with aſſurance of being heard, and that all things ſhall worke together for their good. By occaſion whereof he briefly ſheweth the cauſes of the former benefits, freeing vs from all feare, and concluding that nothing whatſoeuer ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>In the ninth Chapter making proteſtation of his great loue vnto the Iewes, in reſpect of many priuiledges of God vnto them, and ſhewing who were the true ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he handleth two great points: one, of election of ſome to ſaluation: another, of reprobation of ſome to condemnation; without reſpect of good workes in the one, or of an euill worke in the other, onely of his owne will, and yet without any iniuſtice.</p>
               <p>In the tenth Chapter, further profeſſing his loue to all Iſrael, by praying from the deſire of his heart for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, with the cauſes of his ſaid prayer, he taketh occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew the difference of the righteouſnes of the Law and of the Goſpell, prouing that both Iewes and Gentiles that are partakers of the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpell ſhall be ſaued, one meanes whereof he ſheweth to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:210:15"/> calling vpon God from a true and liuely faith, wrought through the preaching of the Goſpell; for that cauſe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how acceptable the Miniſters of the Goſpell ſhould be to all them to whom they preach the Goſpell: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that although the Iſraelites had had the Gopell, yet they had not beleeued and obeyed it; and that therefore the Lord had threatned to take away his word from them, and to giue it vnto the Gentiles, that by their beleeuing thereof and obedience thereunto, he might prouoke the Iewes to the like iealouſie and indignation (as it were) whereto they had prouoked the Lord, becauſe they had not beleeued and obeyed his word. So he concludeth the Chapter with the doctrine of the calling of the Gentiles, long before foretold by <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt, and afterward by <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi> and that becauſe of the diſobedience and rebellion of the Iſra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lites.</p>
               <p>In the eleuenth Chapter proleptically he intreateth at large of a remnant notwithſtanding of the Iſraelites by grace onely to be ſaued, and of another calling yet of them, by a new couenant to be made with them, euen an euerlaſting couenant that ſhould neuer be changed; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing notwithſtanding the Gentiles from inſulting in the reiection before made of the Iſraelites, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them to feare their owne reiection, by the example of the reiection of the Iſraelites; comforting them for all that, by aſſuring them that the Iewes and they ſhould be made one people to God: and ſo concluding the whole doctrine of Gods mercie towards the Iewes and Gentiles, by an holy acclamation of the deep riches and knowledge of God, and of his vnſearchable iudgements in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</p>
               <p>Theſe points of doctrine being largely before handled by the Apoſtle, which now briefly I haue recapitulated, the Apoſtle in the next Chapter and in the Chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing commeth to application, and exhortation, euen to ſuch a life as beſeemeth ſuch doctrine. Now before we ſpeake particularly of the two firſt verſes of this

               <p>Moreouer, exhortation is (as it were) the life of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and doctrine (in ſome ſenſe as it were) the bodie. And therefore as the bodie is dead without the life, ſo is doctrine without exhortation. For this cauſe the Apoſtle much longed and earneſtly prayed to be with the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians. Wherefore? That by his preſence and paines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 9. 10. 11</note> them, <hi>their loue might abound more and more in knowledge and in all iudgement.</hi> And why? He rendreth a reaſon from foure ends of their ſaid abounding in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudgement: two inward, and two outward. Firſt, that <hi>they might be able to diſcerne things that differ,</hi> both doctrines and manners; and ſo not take hob for nob. Secondly, that they <hi>might be pure,</hi> or cleare as the Sunne, from which he borroweth that phraſe, by alluſion to that<note place="margin">Cant. 6. 10.</note> in the Canticles, that is, the ſame within and without; no hypocrites. Theſe two ends are inward. Thirdly, that <hi>they might be without offence;</hi> not for a time, but <hi>till the day of Chriſt.</hi> And laſtly, that they <hi>might be filled with the fruites of righteouſnes,</hi> both of the firſt and of the ſecond Table, towards God and men. Theſe two ends are outward, and concerne the outward conuerſation. In this place, <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudgement,</hi> are for doctrine; the word <hi>loue,</hi> with all the foure former ends, why he would haue their ſaid <hi>loue</hi> ſo to abound in knowledge and iudgement, are for exhortation. And indeed, loue to God and men, will much erre without knowledge and iudgement to direct them: and men alſo cannot diſcerne things that differ, neither be ſound at the heart, nor free from offence, much leſſe filled with the fruits of righteouſnes, without the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudgement to ſhew them what is falſe, what true; what euill, what good: neither can they be ſound and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, except they know what ſoundneſſe and ſincereneſſe is, and how it is to be had, and whereby to be retained. Finally, how can men abound in the fruits of righteouſnes, except they know what workes are righteous, and what vnrighteous?</p>

               <p>Moreouer, doctrine is (as it were) the whole loafe or ioynt of meate; exhortation is the <hi>diuiding of it aright,</hi> and<note place="margin">2.

               <p>All this is not to be ſo vnderſtood as though euery Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the word ſhould be able to teach and exhort in the ſame meaſure.

               <p>Now to returne and to follow the Apoſtle ſtep by ſtep, and word by word, without changing his owne method;<note place="margin">I beſeech.</note> and to begin with his firſt argument prefixed, from the maner of his exhortation. The word tranſlated <hi>I beſeech,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 2. Tit. 2. 15. Heb. 3. 17. and 10. 25.</note> ſignifieth alſo to exhort, and is commonly ſo tranſlated in the places noted in the margin, and after elſe-where.</p>
               <p>Touching this word, let vs note and obſerue that the Prophets immediatly ſent from God, neuer vſed it, but alwayes ſpake more imperatiuely and commandly. So our Sauiour neuer vſed it immediatly, but is alwayes ſaid to haue ſpoken <hi>as hauing power and authoritie.</hi> I ſay, that<note place="margin">Math. 7. 29. Mark. 1. 22. Luk. 4. 32.</note> our Sauiour neuer vſed it immediatly, and ſpeaking in his owne perſon, becauſe mediatly ſpeaking in the Apoſtles he did vſe it. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the perſon of himſelfe and<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 3. 2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> of <hi>Timothy, We are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by vs, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, &amp;c.</hi> VVhy Chriſt himſelfe immediatly vſed it not, the reaſon is plaine, becauſe he was the Lord and Maiſter himſelfe:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:210:20"/> why the Prophets did not ſo ſpeake, I cannot well deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, except it were becauſe they were ſent to the Lords owne people by ſpeciall couenant before, that had obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and rebelliouſly violated the ſaid couenant, and were become <hi>rebellious ſtiffe-necked, and vncircumciſed in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>heart,</hi> though circumciſed in bodie. The Apoſtles do vſe it, becauſe for the moſt part they ſpake to the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 12.</note> before <hi>ſtrangers from the couenant;</hi> by ſuch milde ſpeaking the better to allure them vnto, or encourage them in the faith; or vnto the Iewes that began to relent of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie, and to incline their eares to the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Now touching this place, the Apoſtle had power (as he writeth to <hi>Philemon</hi>) to haue commanded or charged theſe Romanes to doe that which here he requireth of them, and yet <hi>for loues ſake</hi> (as he ſaith further to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi>)<note place="margin">Philemon 8.</note> he did beſeech or exhort them. For <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place to <hi>Philemon,</hi> vſeth the ſame word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that he doth here and in the former places. This he doth in his loue, meekneſſe and mildneſſe, the more to perſwade them, and to winne their loue; the which to do he beſeecheth them rather, then (as he might) comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them.</p>
               <p>But here we are not altogether to paſſe by that that <hi>Thomas a Watering</hi> (I meane <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>) noteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place, namely, that he beſeecheth them, firſt to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, for reuerence of<note place="margin">Philem. 8. Gal. 6. 1. 1.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by ſo intreating them, <hi>Paul</hi> did ſhew his humility; yet that he did it as the poore creepeth and croucheth to the ſurly rich man, is not to be yeelded. Touching the third, that <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo intreate the Romanes as he would haue <hi>Timothy</hi> to intreate Elders as fathers, this likewiſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:210:21"/> is not to be granted, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was many wayes ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, no wayes inferiour to theſe beleeuing Romanes. The ſecond is that I haue before noted, yet the place to the Galatians is not fitly applied, becauſe we reade not theſe Romanes to haue bin ouertaken with ſuch a fault, as whereof the Apoſtle writeth to the Galatians. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe word of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> being a Papiſt, do argue a more modeſt ſpirit in him, then is to be found in the Papiſts of our time.</p>
               <p>To returne, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his loue here beſeecheth theſe Romanes, ſo do the other Apoſtles the like. For proofe whereof I need alledge no places, the thing is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. And this teacheth all Miniſters of the word ſo to do alſo with thoſe with whom they think by ſuch meanes they may preuaile.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:210:21"/> diſcretion and wiſedome, with good reſpect of perſons, of the qualitie of the ſinne, of place, and of the time. I could confirme this by diuers arguments, and illuſtrate it by diuers examples, of Prophets, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, the Apoſtles, diuers ordinary Miniſters that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not in godly maner, ſharply, roundly and worthily ſo to rebuke Kings of Iuda and Iſrael, and other Kings and Emperours; yea not onely thoſe that were wicked, but ſome alſo that were good, as occaſion by their ſinnes required. And ſurely feare and cowardlineſſe in ſparing reprehenſions where they are neceſſary, is ſometimes the betraying of Gods truth the bane of Princes, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of whole kingdomes. But this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt prefixed argument from the maner of <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation in the word, <hi>I beſeech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The illatiue word <hi>Therefore,</hi> hath relation not onely to the 32 verſe of the eleuenth Chapter, <hi>God hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them all in vnbeleefe, that he might haue mercie on all,</hi> but alſo to all the doctrine of the Apoſtle before in part recapitulated; and it is to be ioyned with his mention af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of <hi>the mercies of God,</hi> whereby he doth thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech them.</p>
               <p>Now touching the word <hi>Brethren,</hi> he doth not giue it<note place="margin">Brethren.</note> them as he did before to the Iewes, for he calleth them<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> his <hi>brethren and kinſmen according to the fleſh;</hi> but theſe being by nature of another nation, and heathen, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.

               </p>
               <p>This title of <hi>brethren</hi> being euery where in all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles ſo frequent, I need not to ſtand vpon it, as ſome perhaps would do. Onely thus much, that it is a word te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying loue and humilitie, not proceeding <hi>ex more, ſed examore,</hi> not of cuſtome, but of loue; not vſed to fill vp
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:210:22"/> the ſentence, and to make the phraſe and ſtile the fuller and ſmoother, and the more delightſome to the outward eare, but coming from humilitie, and ſeruing to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of Gods ſacred truth and veritie. As the wicked do ſpue and caſt out bitter words, railings and reuilings<note place="margin">Math. 12. 34, 35.</note> from the abundance of wrath, hatred and malice in their hearts; ſo did the Apoſtles, and ſo ought all good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ſend forth ſuch amiable and kind words from that abundance of vnfained loue in their hearts. Neither is there any repugnance betwixt this word and <hi>babes</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> &amp;c. For in Chriſtianitie, the ſame perſons may be fathers and brothers, and children to the ſame, though they cannot be ſo in fleſh and blood.

               <p>As this ſerueth for reprehenſion of the Pope and all his,<note place="margin">2.

VVhen he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Corinthians for not profiting by the word as<note place="margin">1.

Cor. 15. 1.</note> the reſurrection from the dead? The ſame may be ſaid of many other the like reprehenſions made in loue. Yea, the Lord will haue all reprehenſions of one another, to proceed from the ſame roote; accounting them to hate their brethren in their heart (whatſoeuer they pretend<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 17.</note> outwardly) that do not rebuke him.

VVhen our Sauiour commanded his Diſciples <hi>not to giue that which was holy vnto dogs, neither to caſt their pearles before ſwine;</hi> doth he<note place="margin">Math. 7. 6.</note> not meane that euen amongſt the Iewes that were the onely viſible Church and children of God, there were ſome ſuch ſwine and dogs? Yea that apparently were ſuch: otherwiſe that precept needed not. For he forbad his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples<note place="margin">Math. 10. 5.

               <p>But may a Miniſter, ſpeaking generally to an auditorie, wherein he knoweth and ſeeth ſuch, call them by the name of Brethren?

               <p>This title ſo often occurring in the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles, teacheth vs what naturall loue there ought to be betwixt Miniſters and people; and that the people are to accept of their doctrine, admonitions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and reprehenſions, as of the beſt brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, according to that that before we heard.

                  </gap>ation of mercie by ſome worke. Both words, the primitiue and deriuatiue haue relation to miſerie. Now the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſignifieth the manifold works of Gods mercie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manifold miſeries of men. Gods mercie is but one; yea all that is in God is but one, as God himſelfe is but one. For God is ſo ſimple an eſſence, that he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 6.</note> no varietie in him. Diuers attributes are aſcribed to God; but that is onely for our capacitie, and according to his applying of himſelfe to our manifold neceſſities: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe whatſoeuer is in God, is all but one. Now the plurall number is here and elſewhere vſed, in reſpect of our manifold ſinnes, and like manifold miſeries by our ſinnes. For as many diſeaſes require many medicines, and<note place="margin">Pſal 77. 10. 106. 7. 2. Cor. 1. 3.</note> many ſores craue many plaiſters; ſo our manifold ſinnes and miſeries require many medicines, or many workes of Gods mercie.</p>
               <p>This argument is like to that, <hi>I Paul my ſelfe beſeech you</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>by the meekneſſe and gentleneſſe of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> There is ſome ſimilitude (I ſay) betwixt theſe two places. Onely herein is the difference, that in the one place he ſaith <hi>the mercies</hi> plurally, and in the other <hi>the meekneſſe and gentleneſſe</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly: ſecondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one place there is the name of <hi>God,</hi> in the other of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> By <hi>mercies</hi> he meaneth alſo in this place, Gods works of mercie onely concerning our ſoules and the life to come. For this word <hi>therefore,</hi> referreth vs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:210:24"/> onely to thoſe things that the Apoſtle had before written, euen to all thoſe paſſages of Gods dealing before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and before in part recapitulated by me, as to <hi>iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith without the workes of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> In all the former part of the Epiſtle the Apoſtle had not mentioned any mercie of God concerning this life: all before ſaid, concerneth euerlaſting ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Now by ſpeaking plurally of mercies, he noreth that all<note place="margin">All the mercies of God do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of any. Epheſ. 4. 7.</note> the former mercies of God do concurre and muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the ſaluation of euery one appointed to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whoſoeuer hath one, hath all. One is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without all. Yet this is to be vnderſtood firſt, of all common mercies; I meane common to all the elect: ſecondly, of all ſuch in ſeuerall meaſures. There are many mercies of the life to come, ſpecially belonging to ſome ſpeciall perſons, as appeareth by thoſe particulars here mentioned in verſes 6. 7. 8. All ſuch graces are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for all, neither do concurre in all. The ſpeciall workes<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 4.</note> alſo of Gods mercie to ſpeciall callings, are not all alike, and wrought in equall meaſure. But <hi>to euery one is giuen grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>there</hi>
                  <note place="margin">verſ. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>are diuerſities of gifts but the ſame Spirit.</hi> And in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Hauing gifts differing &amp;c.</hi> And what need ſo graue an admonition in verſe 3. <hi>by the grace giuen to Paul that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man among theſe Chriſtian Romanes ſhould not thinke of himſelfe more highly then he ought to thinks,</hi> if all mercies or graces were alike in all?<note place="margin">Gods mercies to come, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any paſt or preſent.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Not to ſtand any longer hereupon, but to proceed; by <hi>the mercies of God</hi> in this place, he meaneth not onely mercies paſt, and mercies preſent, but alſo mercies to come; which are greater then any we haue had or haue. Firſt, becauſe they ſhall be in heauen; whereas theſe are all here below. Secondly, becauſe they ſhall be without feare of any loſſe, of any depriuation, of any of diminution. Thirdly, they ſhall not be by degrees as here, but all at once, and euerlaſting. But are our mercies here vncertain? Not ſo: yet in reſpect of our weakneſſe, and of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:210:25"/> and power of our aduerſaries, both without vs, and<note place="margin">Philip. 2. 12. 1. Pet. 1. 17.</note> alſo within vs, we are neuer without feare, neither muſt be; not of loſing, but of ceaſing them, and of weakning and obſcuring our aſſurance of them. Fourthly, Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to come, are greater then any paſt or preſent, becauſe they ſhall be without any miſery at all. And as in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects they are greater, ſo they are alſo as certaine as thoſe that here already we haue.</p>
               <p>And the mercies of God which here we haue, are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances<note place="margin">Gods future mercies as ſure as any paſt or preſent. Numb. 23. 19. Iam. 1. 17. Heb. 6. 17. 1. Pet. 1. 19.</note> of thoſe we ſhal haue. And for our better aſſurance of them, we are firſt of all to conſider the immutable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, bound with a ſolemne oath, euen by his owne name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are as ſure as thoſe that we haue, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the great price of our redemption, euen <hi>the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> For, hath Chriſt redeemed vs with ſo great a price, and will he loſe vs?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of Chriſts interceſſion in our behalfe for thoſe mercies: firſt, whileſt he was here in earth: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 24. Rom. 8. 32. Ioh. 11. 42.</note> now in heauen. This reaſon is the ſtronger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is <hi>heard alwayes;</hi> and God cannot but heare him, becauſe he is his Sonne <hi>in whom he is well pleaſed:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17. 1. Pet. 3. 18. 1. Ioh. 2. 1.</note> and he was alwayes iuſt, neuer ſinning, either in any other thing or in praying.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as before he did and now doth make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs, ſo it was the end of his aſcending into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>to prepare a place for vs.</hi> Hath he prepared a place for<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 2.</note> vs, and ſhall we be fruſtrated of it?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Chriſt hath not onely promiſed theſe future mercies, but alſo vpon his promiſe, and to bind himſelfe the more to the performance thereof, he hath <hi>giuen vs the earneſt of his Spirit.</hi> Will he loſe his earneſt? Can any force<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 22. Epheſ. 1. 13, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>from all iniquitie,</hi> and alſo that we ſhall be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from all miſeries of this life, and from death it ſelfe, as they are puniſhments of ſinne; ſo that we may ſay euen whiles we liue here, <hi>Death is ſwallowed vp into victory: O</hi>

                  <hi>I haue written?</hi> and ſhall not God ſay the ſame much more of them whom he hath bleſſed, and whoſe names he hath written in heauen and in the booke of life.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, the Apoſtle hath aſſured vs that he will make <hi>our vile bodies like vnto his glorious bodie:</hi> and that <hi>when he</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 3. 21. Col. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall appeare, we ſhall appeare with him in glorie:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>we ſhallbe like him, and ſee him as he is.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, the wicked ſouldiers that brake the bones
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:210:26"/> of the theeues crucified with Chriſt, could not breake his bones, becauſe it was written of the Paſſe-ouer a type of Chriſt, <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi> Was it not poſſible for a bone of his naturall bodie to be broken, becauſe it<note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 33. 36.</note> was ſo written; and ſhall it be poſſible for any whole mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his myſticall bodie to be vtterly loſt?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly and laſtly, (not to be tedious herein) <hi>None of the ſheepe of Chriſt that haue heard his voice and followed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 28. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>him, can be taken out of Chriſts hand: becauſe the Father that hath giuen them vnto him, is ſtronger then all.</hi> And <hi>all the children of God, begotten againe through the rich mercie of God, are kept and guarded</hi> (as I ſaid before) <hi>by the power of God &amp;c.</hi> Is it not blaſpemous either to ſay that God is<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 5. In Chap. 1. at the end.</note> vnrighteous, or to denie his omnipotencie, that he is not able to keepe his owne? May we not vpon theſe grounds crie out, O the vnſearchable riches of Gods goodneſſe, as well as of his wiſedome? May we not breake out into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the happie and bleſſed ſtate and condition of all them that are partaker of ſuch mercies of God? Oh then how forcible an argument is this of the Apoſtle, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke, vrge and preſſe all by theſe <hi>mercies to preſent their bodies a ſacrifice vnto God?</hi> Yea certainly this argument is greater then whatſoeuer can be vrged to this purpoſe from all the iudgements of God. We are many times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked<note place="margin">Ioſ. 23. 8. &amp;c. and 24. 14. 1. Sam. 12. 24.</note> to cleaue vnto God, to feare God, &amp;c. by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the great works of his mercie for this life, both performed and alſo promiſed: how much more then ought theſe his great mercies of the life to come quicken vs thus <hi>to preſent our bodies a ſacrifice, liuing, holy, acceptable.</hi> Therefore this Apoſtle from the doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead in that glorious maner that he had deſcribed the ſame, inferreth this exhortation to ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in iudgement, and to abounding in all good workes with conſtancie; <hi>Therefore my beloued brethren be ſtedfaſt,</hi>

Doth not <hi>Iohn</hi> likewiſe exhort to loue one another vnfainedly and in deed, as well as in word, from our knowledge that we<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 14. 18. 19.</note> are tranſlated from death vnto life, and of our being in truth for the preſent, and from aſſurance of our hearts before him for the time to come? Away therefore with all doctrine of Poperie, that teacheth the certaintie of Gods mercie to come, to be the doctrine of ſecuritie and libertie. Away with all Arminianiſme, that teacheth that no man can be ſure of his ſaluation; and that men partaker of the former mercies, may for all that loſe all,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 9.</note> and vtterly and finally fall away from grace. All ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections to the contrary, are ſtrawy, watery and weake. The maineſt obiection of all other from Heb. 6. 4. &amp;c. is dog-lame; yea, the legs thereof are ſo cut off in the very<note place="margin">9. 10.</note> ſame place, verſ. 9. 10. that it muſt haue legs made of wood to ſupport it, that will be burnt with the fire. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle adding, that he was <hi>perſwaded better things of them, and ſuch as did accompanie ſaluation,</hi> prouing the ſame from the very righteouſneſſe of God, in thoſe reſpects that before I haue ſpoken, doth by his ſaid words plainly teach vs, that he had not before ſpoken of ſuch things as neceſſarily accompanie ſaluation. Can there be any thing better then faith, and theſe mercies of God appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith? Therefore it is certaine that the Apoſtle had not before ſpoken of ſuch things, as in verſe the 9. he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:210:27"/> calleth <hi>better things, and ſuch as accompanie ſaluation.</hi> They that fall away from the communion of Saints, and that loſe their taſte of thoſe mercies they ſeemed to haue, neuer were of the Saints, neither euer indeed had receiued thoſe<note place="margin">1.

I haue ſeene a little dog-bolt booke, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by ſome that ſtyle themſelues, <hi>falſly called Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts:</hi> but it is lamentable to ſee how the poore men moile themſelues in their errors, and how they are puzzled with the former place of <hi>Iohn,</hi> labouring to anſwer it, but moſt fouly abuſing it, ſaying themſelues cannot tell what. They multiply words indeed, but in them not a word to purpoſe, neither worth any anſwer.</p>
               <p>But to returne and proceed; doth not this our Apoſtle from the very promiſes of God made to the Iewes in old time, mentioned in the end of the 2. Cor. 6. prouoke vs Gentiles engrafted into Chriſt, to <hi>purge our ſelues from all</hi>

                  <note place="margin">verſe 21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord (I ſay) threatning theſe things, doth not onely teach vs that afflictions are for ſinne, but that alſo they are medicines to cure vs of ſin, and ſo to reforme vs, that we may preſent our ſelues ſuch a ſacrifice as here we are exhorted vnto. The ſame is manifeſt by other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Iob 5. 17. Pſal. 94. 12. Pro. 3. 12. Heb. 12. 5. Reuel. 3. 19.</note> that in the former conſiderations pronounce him bleſſed whom the Lord chaſtiſeth; as alſo that teach, the Lord to loue them whom he correcteth. By all theſe things we ſee, that we may well reckon the Lords chaſtiſements among his mercies. And therefore the more the Lord hath exerciſed any in ſuch maner, the more euery ſuch man ſhould labour to preſent himſelfe ſuch a ſacrifice to God, leſt he ſend ſeuen times more ſuch plagues vpon him,<note place="margin">Leuit. 26. 18 &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> ſuch chaſtiſements not being the leaſt of Gods mercies. For, whom he loueth, he will not leaue: but though he make no vſe of one affliction to the bettering of himſelfe yet he ſhall haue another, till he be reformed of ſuch euils as for the which the Lord hath ſo before once, or twice, or thrice afflicted him. Let euery man therefore be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by Gods chaſtiſements, not onely according to theſe Scriptures before alledged, but alſo according to the counſell of our Sauiour to him that had; bin ſo impotent for 38 yeares, that he was not able to helpe himſelfe, and<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 14.</note> whom he had reſtored with a word of his mouth, <hi>Behold, thou art made whole; ſinne no more, leſt a worſe thing come vnto thee.</hi> But of this ſomewhat more afterward.</p>
               <p>All the former mercies, and euery one of them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the life to come, are ſo great, that he is more then ſtonie, yea of a ſteely heart, that will not be prouoked by them to giue himſelfe ſuch a ſacrifice, as here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, although the Apoſtle in the former part of the Epiſtle, hath treated onely of Gods mercies for the life to come, and from them eſpecially doth in this place exhort the beleeuing Romanes and all other <hi>to giue their bodies a ſacrifice vnto God;</hi> yet Gods mercies alſo of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:210:28"/> this life, being appendices of them, and appurtenances vnto them, ought to moue vs ſo to do: the rather, becauſe that God by the giuing of Chriſt for vs (as the fountaine<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> of all mercies) hath aſſured vs <hi>freely with him to giue vs all things.</hi> If all things, then alſo the mercies of this life. Hath not Chriſt alſo promiſed alſo all mercies euen for this life to be caſt vpon them that <hi>firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe?</hi> And indeed the bleſſings of<note place="margin">Math. 6. 33.</note> this life, great and ſmall, are not onely free gifts in reſpect of our vnworthineſſe of them, but they are alſo mercies, both in reſpect of that miſerable ſtate wherein all men are firſt borne (euen the children of Princes as well as of the pooreſt,) yea more weake and miſerable then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures at their firſt comming into the world, and alſo becauſe the firſt parents of all mankind by their firſt ſinne brought themſelues and all their poſteritie into all miſeries of this life, depriuing themſelues and all theirs of all thoſe bleſſings euen of this life, that before the Lord had moſt richly endowed them withall. In this regard therefore, we here in England haue greater cauſe thus to preſent our ſelues a ſacrifice vnto God, becauſe as the, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet after enumeration of many bleſſings and mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon the Iſraelites, whereby he had prouoked them to praiſe the Lord, he concludeth with theſe words, <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with any nation,</hi> ſo we may truly ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 20.</note> that the Lord hath not dealt ſo with any nation in his bountifull bleſſings and mercies, euen of this life as well as of the life to come, as he hath dealt with vs here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: eſpecially at this time may we ſay ſo, becauſe we daily heare and almoſt ſee all our neighbors round about vs <hi>as ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter, to be killed all the day</hi>

But let vs at the laſt make this right vſe of the mercies of God for this life, that <hi>Samuel</hi> commended to the Iſraelites, ſaying,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 12. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Feare ye the Lord and ſerue him &amp;c. and conſider how great things the Lord hath done for you.</hi> If we ſtill go on in our ſinnes and ſecuritie, <hi>and do wickedly</hi> (not preſenting our ſelues ſuch a ſacrifice vnto God, as here the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs vnto) let vs beware of that which he threatneth<note place="margin">verſ. 25.</note> in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>As this argument from theſe outward mercies towards vs here in this Land, is generally to be applied vnto all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:210:29"/> (becauſe all haue a ſhare in them,) ſo let euery man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſider, that the greater meaſure of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies the Lord hath beſtowed vpon him, the more he endeuours to preſent himſelfe ſuch a ſacrifice to God as here we are called vpon to preſent. For if <hi>to whom</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>men haue committed much, of him they will aske the more;</hi> wil not the Lord do the like? But doth euery man make this particular vſe of Gods mercies for this life, particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the Lord? Alas no, but cleane contrary; he withdraweth himſelfe the more from God; and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that any man (for the moſt part) is in outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, the more he hardneth his heart and face againſt God, and the more he thinketh he may ſin both againſt God and alſo againſt men. Therefore if there be any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in any great men, though it be neuer ſo poore and little, we vſe to ſay, Little is much in ſuch a man. Whereas indeed we ſhould rather ſay, It is nothing in ſuch a man, as for whom the Lord hath done ſo much. For doubtleſſe for the leaſt of Gods bleſſings for this life, a man is more in his debt; and the more he dayly receiueth of that kind, into the greater arrerages he runneth with him, euen ſuch as he ſhall neuer be able to diſcharge; ſo that he may well ſay, <hi>What ſhall I render vnto the Lord for all his benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>

                  <hi>me.</hi> And if we make this vſe of ſuch bleſſings for this life, then ſhall they alſo be mercies of the life to come: but if we do not, then ſhall they be iudgements of this life and of the life to come. And when we haue delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neuer ſo long, what to render vnto the Lord for theſe or for other ſorts of his mercies, we muſt not dreame of making God any recompence, (for how <hi>can a man be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi>

Oh that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall and laſciuious ſonnes would do the like! ſuch as are ſwaggerers, drunkards or great drinkers, though not vnto drunkenneſſe, riotous, waſte-goods, ſtubburne, rebellious,<note place="margin">Iſai. 5. 11. Luk. 18. 2.</note> neither fearing God nor reuerencing men, no not their fathers that begat them, nor their mothers that bare them with great paines, and gaue them ſuck with many a pinch, and in their age haue more ſorow of heart by them then euer they had ioy before. Oh that all other vngodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would do the like. If they be very graceleſſe children (as there are too many) that will not ſubmit themſelues to their parents, and performe dutie vnto them from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſuch before mentioned fatherly and mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindneſſes; how graceleſſe are they to God, how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, how rebellious, that from theſe his mercies will not be prouoked to yeeld their bodies a ſacrifice vnto him? They therefore are enemies to all pietie, and to theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and to all grace of God, that from the ſame do argue for all libertie and impietie, ſaying (being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of their ſinne, and exhorted to reformation) What? God is mercifull, he is not ſo hard as you make him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if Gods mercies be ſo great and certain vnto
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:210:30"/> men moſt vnworthy of them, how ſhould this prouoke one man to ſhew mercie to another, in imitation of this mercie of God, according to that of our Sauiour, <hi>Be ye</hi>

                  <hi>mercifull as your Father alſo is mercifull.</hi> And hath he not ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall receiue mercie?</hi> Hath not the Apoſtle alſo ſaid, <hi>There ſhall be iudgement mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe to him that ſheweth no mercie?</hi> but mercie reioyceth againſt iudgement. God hath no need of vs, but we haue need one of another. We cannot <hi>be profitable to God,</hi> but<note place="margin">Iob 22. 2.</note> we may be beneficial one to another; yea the pooreſt that is, to the greateſt, as diuers other wayes, ſo eſpecially by praying for him, as the Prophet of Iuda was vnto <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 13. 6.</note> by his prayer curing his withered hand. Yea, we may deſerue kindneſſe one of another; but (as in part hath bin ſhewed before) we cannot recompence God for that we haue had of him, much leſſe can we merit any new bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Beſides all the premiſes, if Gods mercies be ſo great as we haue heard, how highly are we to eſteeme of the word of God, the cabinet or casket wherein all the ſaid mercies of God are contained, and whereby likewiſe the Lord conueyeth them all vnto vs, and the which it ſelfe is one of the principalleſt mercies? Yea further, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are all Gods Miniſters to be regarded, that faithfully bring thoſe mercies vnto vs? euen ſo highly, that we ſhould receiue them as the Galatians ſometime did <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 14. 2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> euen <hi>as an Angell of God, yea as Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, for whom they are Ambaſſadours:</hi> and finally, <hi>that if it were poſſible</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in the former place to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians) <hi>we ſhould plucke out our owne eyes, and giue them vnto them, if thereby we might do them good.</hi> If <hi>as Chriſt laid downe his life for vs, we ought to lay downe ours for the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>brethren,</hi> ſhould we not much more do the ſame for faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters that teach vs, and are Gods hands to deliuer<note place="margin">Iſai. 52. 7.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:210:30"/> preaching neuer ſo freely and without any charge vnto them, do reproue them or theirs; yea if from the guiltineſſe of their conſciences they do but thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or theirs reproued, then they take them to be their enemies, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Eliah.</hi> Sometime alſo they ſhake their<note place="margin">1.

But of the regard of the Miniſters of the word, more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
               <p>Here alſo from theſe words, <hi>the mercies of God,</hi> let vs learne humilitie, and acknowledge all that we haue to come from Gods mercie in reſpect of our miſerie; euen a pluralitie of mercies in reſpect of the pluralitie of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. How then can any boaſt of any merits in reſpect of any works? How can any man glorie in himſelfe? Yea, let all men giue all glorie to God for deliuering them from their manifold miſeries, by vouchſafing them ſo manifold mercies. But it ſhall be ſufficient thus briefly to haue poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it were with the finger at this point of humilitie by Gods mercies. To conclude this argument from Gods mercies, the more mercie that any man hath receiued, the more let him preſent his bodie a ſacrifice to God. But wil ſome man ſay, do you not forget your ſelfe by ſpeaking of more mercie? For did you not before ſay, that all Gods mercies of the life to come go together? and he that hath one, hath all? if therfore euery one haue all that hath any, how can he haue more? can there be more then all? I ſaid ſo indeed, and ſo ſay againe: and do not you forget your ſelfe that thinke to take me napping, your ſelfe being napping? For to omit that before in ſaying as now you charge me, that all Gods mercies go together, I ſpake onely of his mercies for the life to come; I haue now ſpoken of the mercies of this life, which are giuen more in number to one then to another, to omit this (I ſay) I pray you remember that before I ſpake of <hi>mercies</hi> in the plurall number, now I ſpeake of <hi>mercie</hi> in the ſingular
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:210:31"/> number. Although therefore all Gods common mercies for the life to come and accompanying ſaluation do go together, ſo that where there is one, there are all; yet I ſaid alſo before, that the mercies of God are giuen in ſeuerall meaſures touching the particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowledge, faith, hope, loue, patience, humilitie, temperance, &amp;c. go all together, (yea ſo, that he in whom any ſinne reigneth, hath none of all theſe) notwithſtanding though he that hath one of theſe hath all, yet euery man hath not theſe in the ſame meaſure; ſome haue knowledge in a greater meaſure then other; ſo alſo faith: the ſame is to be ſaid of the reſt. This therefore is my meaning, that euery man the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the more faith he hath, the more hope, the more loue, and the more and greater meaſure he hath of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercie, the more he giue himſelfe a ſacrifice to God, for the more glorifying of God. Let no man boaſt of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mercies of God in him then are in other, but let him conſecrate himſelfe the more vnto God, and glorifie God the more. Thus much of the three arguments prefixed to the exhortation.</p>

                  <hi>to iudgement,</hi> how can it be offered by any vpon the earth? And who by the doctrine of the Papiſts themſelues know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when it is offered. For without the intention of the Prieſt for making thereof, there is no offering of it, as themſelues affirme in the celebration of their Maſſe. Now who knoweth or can know the intention of the Prieſt? Whether alſo do they make the bodie of Chriſt (as they ſpeake) in the ſtate of humiliation or of glorification? Is God alſo the onely maker of all other things, euen of the leaſt worme, and can a ſhauen Prieſt make the bodie of Chriſt? Did the onely mightie power of God raiſe the bodie of Chriſt out of the graue, and afterward exalt it to heauen; and ſhall euery ſuch greaſie Prieſt at his pleaſure be of power to fetch it from heauen? Or hath Chriſt now two bodies, one in the ſtate of humiliation, another in the ſtate of glorification; one viſible in the heauens, another inuiſible in the earth? Yea, how many millions of Chriſts bodie do they make here in earth? For they will denie,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:210:32"/> that in the celebration of their Maſſe, where and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the body of Chriſt is receiued <hi>perfruſta,</hi> by peeces or ſcraps; but they auouch that euery one receiueth the whole bodie of Chriſt. So then there muſt be ſo many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Chriſt, not onely as there are Maſſes celebrated in all the world, but alſo as there are ſeuerall communicants in the whole world, and yet forſooth the bodie of Chriſt muſt ſtill remaine whole. O noble Arithmeticians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let no Merchants therefore, or any other that haue great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to make, euer make vp their reckonings and caſt vp their accounts, without ſome Maſſe-prieſt preſent, by whom they may make the ſpeedier worke.

               <p>Yea further, I pray you note another abhomination in their Maſſe. For they ſay, that euery one receiueth the whole bodie of Chriſt, fleſh, blood and bone, really and materially with his bodily mouth, as it was borne of the virgin <hi>Marie:</hi> but whether ſo little as then it was, or of full growth, that they tell not.

But ſoft; they haue not yet determined whether (as I ſaid) it be the bodie of Chriſt glorified, or as it was in the ſhape of a ſeruant. Well then, demurre a while, and conſult one with another of that. In the meane time, whether of both they meane; is it not much worſe then the ſtable wherein he was borne, and the manger wherein ſo borne he was laid? Yet who can expreſſe the ſauage barbarouſneſſe of the people, in vouchſafing the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> no better roome, though they knew her not to be with child of the Sauiour of the world? How horrible an indignity therefore is this, ſo to abaſe Chriſts body, he being ſo mightily declared to be the Son of God? Yea, this is moſt horrible blaſphemie:

                  <note place="margin">Reuel. 1. 18.</note> And if they do againe ſo crucifie Chriſt, let them take that which followeth in the former place to the Hebrewes, and acknowledge themſelues to be ſo <hi>fallen away that they cannot be renewed by repentance,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cannot repent.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, they ſay their Maſſe is a Sacrament. <hi>Non ſententias, ſed contradictoria loquuntur carnifices.</hi> Theſe but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſpeake not ſentences, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (in ſome ſort) contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. For if it be a Sacrament, as the Supper of the Lord is to be acknowledged, then is it not ſuch a ſacrifice as they ſpeake of. For, a ſacrament &amp; a ſacrifice are two ſuch diſtinct &amp; diuers things, that the one cannot be the other. A ſacrament cannot be a ſacrifice, neither can a ſacrifice be a ſacrament. If it be obiected, that the Paſſe-ouer was a ſacrament, and yet a ſacrifice; I denie the latter, namely<note place="margin">The Paſſe-ouer was no ſacrifice</note> that it was a ſacrifice properly ſo called. For euery ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was to be ſlaine by the Prieſts, and to be offered at the Tabernacle and Altar of the Lord: but the Paſſe-ouer was to beſlaine, yea eaten alſo by euery family; it was to <hi>be roaſted with fire, leauing no part thereof till the morning;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 8.</note> it was not at all to be conſumed by fire, as other ſacrifices were. If yet it be obiected, that it is called a ſacrifice. I firſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:210:33"/> aske where? Secondly I ſay, it might improperly be ſo called as a type of Chriſt, of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>our Paſſe-ouer is ſacrificed for vs.</hi> Thirdly, in reſpect of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peace-offerings after the firſt inſtitution offered at<note place="margin">2. Chro. 32. 22. and 35. 7.</note> the firſt celebration thereof. In which reſpects the Supper of the Lord hath bin by the Fathers often called a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, becauſe of the praiſes of God, prayers to God, and almes giuen to men when the ſame hath bin celebrated. Beſides all the premiſes, that the Paſſe-ouer was no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice properly ſo called, it is manifeſt by expreſſe Scripture,<note place="margin">Exod. 8. 25. 26.</note> becauſe when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> gaue libertie to the Iſraelites to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Lord in Egypt, <hi>Moſes</hi> anſwered, that <hi>it was not meete ſo to do, &amp;c.</hi> And yet afterward they ſlue and did eate the Paſſe-ouer in Egypt. Therefore I conclude, that<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> the Paſſe-ouer was not properly a ſacrifice, but onely as before I ſaid. And touching the bodie of Chriſt, I alſo conclude, that neither any ſhauen Prieſt nor any other is now to offer the ſame, but that all Chriſtian religion conſiſteth in the receiuing thereof, yea of whole Chriſt, not into their bodies, but into their hearts by a true and liuely faith. But leauing theſe their blaſphemies to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to the iudgement and condemnation of God, I proceed.</p>
               <p>Now hauing ſhewed the bodie of Chriſt not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes here meant, neither now to be offered by any ſhaueling Prieſt, or any other, as the Popiſh Church blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly ſay they offer it daily in their Maſſe; let vs more fully ſee what yet is meant by theſe words <hi>your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> I do therefore vnderſtand by them (as I ſaid) our whole man, bodies and ſoules. The word <hi>bodie</hi> indeed properly ſignifieth but one part of vs, that was at the firſt made of the earth, and that we now take from our parents,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> and ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from our ſoules at the firſt, and now alſo infuſed into the bodie immediatly by God. So<note place="margin">Zech. 12. 1. Heb. 12. 9. 2. Cor. 7. 1. Iſai. 4. 6.</note> it is the ſame with the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> though the word <hi>fleſh</hi> haue diuers other ſignifications moſt commonly for all mankind, as alſo for the whole corruption and old man,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:210:33"/> and ſo it is oppoſed to the word <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that is, the new<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1. 2. &amp;c.</note> man, wrought by the Spirit of God in vs.</p>
               <p>In the proper ſignification thereof the word <hi>bodie</hi> is taken in diuers other places: as when it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall change our vile bodie, &amp;c.</hi> and when <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth <hi>God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſanctifie the Theſſalonians throughout in ſoule, bodie and ſpirit:</hi> ſo alſo when to the Hebrewes the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>they were waſhed in their bodies, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo in the doctrine<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> of the reſurrection, and often elſewhere. But in this place it is taken for the whole man conſiſting of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. So it is taken when the ſecond perſon in the Deitie is broght in ſaying, <hi>A bodie haſt thou prepared for me.</hi> So after<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5. 10.</note> when it is ſaid, <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified, through the offering of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 24.</note> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt in his bodie bare our ſinnes vpon the Croſſe.</hi> In all which places the bodie of Chriſt is taken for the whole humane nature of Chriſt, ſoule and bodie, yea alſo for the whole perſon of Chriſt God and man; in which reſpect by communication of the properties it is ſaid<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> that <hi>God hath purchaſed his Church by his owne blood.</hi> So likewiſe our bodie is taken for our whole man, when the<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let not ſinne therefore reigne in your mortall bodie.</hi> For he forbiddeth ſin to reigne as well in the ſoule as in the bodie: and although the ſoule be immortall, yet the whole man ioyntly is mortall. And ſo <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith, that when he ſaith bodie <hi>per ſynecdochen,</hi> he doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole man, as ſometime by the word <hi>ſoule</hi> he doth the like. For ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> is ſaid to haue entred into Egypt with <hi>ſeuentie ſoules:</hi> and yet preſently after he ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 46. 26.</note> that in this place it is not a name of nature but of vice: For our corrupt affections are to be mortified, and good are to be put into their place, that our ſacrifice may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. But I confeſſe I do not well vnderſtand how theſe words do accord with the former. Some other for all that do ſo interprete the words <hi>our bodies</hi> in this place, viz. not for our whole man, neither for our natural bodies diſtinct from our ſoules, but onely for our whole naturall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:210:34"/> corruption, as the word <hi>fleſh</hi> (as before I ſhewed) is diuers times ſo taken. Of theſe <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon this place ſeemeth to be the ancienteſt and chiefeſt: <hi>Our bodies</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubiect to ſinne, are not accounted liuing but dead.</hi> Then he ſaith, <hi>Non enim ſicut tunc corpora pro corporibus immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur, nunc vero non corpora ſed vitia corporis ſunt perimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi> For not as then bodies are ſacrificed for bodies, but now not the bodies, but the vices of the bodie are to be ſlaine. Their reaſon ſeemeth to haue bin, becauſe as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinnes, fornication, vncleanneſſe, &amp;c. are called our<note place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>earthly members;</hi> ſo our whole corruption is called by the name of <hi>the body of death,</hi> as when <hi>Paul</hi> crieth out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from the bodie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>of this death?</hi> But for my part I rather approue of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer interpretation of our bodies to ſignifie our whole man, as M. <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo interpreteth it, becauſe it is ſaid our bodies muſt be a ſacrifice liuing, but our whole old man muſt be ſlaine, mortified and crucified. How alſo can the old man properly be ſaid to be holy and acceptable vnto God? when it is killed and mortified, it is not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and not being mortified, it is altogether vnholy and odious vnto God, who hareth all that is euill.</p>
               <p>That our whole man, ſoule and bodie, muſt be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Our whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoule and body muſt be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to God.

Secondly, ſo alſo by <hi>Dauids</hi> prayer for himſelfe, wholy, not in part to be waſhed. Thirdly, ſo by Chriſts ſharp reprehenſion of the Phariſies for their waſhing themſelues onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, for <hi>making cleane the outſide of the cup and of the</hi>

                  <hi>platter,</hi> and for being like to whited ſepulchers, &amp;c. but <hi>within full of dead mens bones and of all vncleanneſſe.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">ver. 27.</note> our whole man hath ſinned, therefore our whole man muſt be offered to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fiftly, our whole man was at the firſt created, and after our fall redeemed. Sixtly, in the world to come we deſire our whole man to be glorified,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:210:34"/> and ſo it ſhall be. Seuenthly, Chriſt ſuffered in his whole man, in ſoule and in bodie, in the one as well as in the other. And it is to be obſerued, that as the word <hi>ſoule</hi> is expreſſed by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſo the word vſed by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Iſai. 53. 10.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſoule. And ſo it was neceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer and preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ſacrifice to God in both parts of his humane nature, that he might be a perfect Sauiour vnto vs of our ſoules and bodies, becauſe wee had ſinned in both. And this Chriſts ſuffering in ſoule as well as in bodie, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by his threefold moſt earneſt prayer to God, to be deliuered from that paſſion if it had bin poſſible: by his <hi>ſweat trickling downe like great drops of blood:</hi> by his bitter<note place="margin">Math. 26. 39. Luk 22. 44. Math. 27. 46. Ioh. 12. 27.</note> crie vpon the Croſſe, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> yea alſo by his prayer to be deliuered from that <hi>houre</hi> long before. All theſe things do plainly teſtifie, that Chriſt ſuffered more then in bodie onely, euen in ſoule alſo; and not ſuch puniſhment as man onely did inflict, but the heauie wrath and indignation of God his Father. For many a man hath ſuffered as great torments in body and greater, that hath not ſo prayed to be deliuered from his ſufferings, nor ſo ſweat nor ſo cried out. Moreouer, the neceſſitie of Chriſts ſuch ſuffering, and conſequently of his ſo offering himſelfe, is further manifeſt, becauſe himſelfe ſpeaking of his ſuffering before, ſaith, not onely that he ſhould or would ſo ſuffer, but alſo that <hi>he muſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 16. 21. Mar. 8. 31. Luk. 9. 23. and 17. 25. Ioh. 12. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuffer death, &amp;c.</hi> Yea he ſheweth the neceſſitie of his death by the ſimilitude of a graine of wheate, that <hi>except it die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruite:</hi> thereby teaching, that except hee ſhould be put to death, the ſaluation of man could not haue bin effected. After his reſurrection alſo, is it not ſaid by the two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that Chriſt had before ſaid, that <hi>the Sonne of man muſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>be deliuered into the hands of ſinners, and be crucified &amp;c.</hi> Doth not Chriſt himſelfe alſo rebuke the two Diſciples that were walking to Emaus, in this maner, <hi>Oh fooles and ſlow of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue ſpoken!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">verſ. 25. 26.</note>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:210:35"/> 
                  <hi>ought not Chriſt to haue ſuffered theſe things, and to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his glorie?</hi> Doth not this word <hi>ought,</hi> plainly import a neceſſitie?</p>
               <p>The neceſſitie of Chriſt dying and ſuffering all that he<note place="margin">A threefold neceſsitie of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Act. 2. 23. Math. 26. 54. Luk. 24. 25.</note> did for our ſaluation, is threefold. Firſt, becauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate counſell of God. Secondly, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of former Scriptures which had ſpoken of his ſaid ſufferings: yea, not onely the plaine words of Scriptures, but alſo all the ſacrifices of the Law, which were all offered by death, as types of Chriſt. Thirdly, for expiation of our ſinnes, which could not otherwiſe haue bin taken away then by his being made a curſe for vs; becauſe it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things that are written in the booke of the Law.</hi> The iuſtice of God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required all his ſaid ſufferings, euen that he ſhould not ſuffer ſomething onely, but all: neither did it ſtand with the wiſedome of our Sauiour to ſuffer more then he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, himſelfe hauing taught, that <hi>men ſhall giue an account</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 12. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>of euery idle word in the day of iudgement:</hi> ſhall they not then much more giue account of euery thing they haue done or ſuffered more then they needed? I haue the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoken thus much hereof, in confutation as of other Papiſts, ſo of <hi>Stella,</hi> that is not any <hi>ex ſtellis fixis,</hi> of the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Stella on Luke 9. 31.</note> ſtarres, but a Planet, a wandring ſtarre, both in himſelfe and alſo in his endeuours to deceiue and ſeduce others, and to leade them out of the way, like vnto the Meteor that the Philoſophers call <hi>ignem fatuum,</hi> the fooliſh fire, burning vp and downe till it be wholy conſumed. But what doth he teach or ſay? that <hi>one drop of Chriſts blood had bin ſufficient to haue ſaued the whole world;</hi> and that <hi>we are not ſaued by the quantitie of Chriſts ſufferings, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the dignitie of his perſon.</hi> So what needed Chriſt to haue ſweat ſo many great drops of blood, and afterward<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 44. Ioh. 19. 1. and 34.</note> to haue ſhed ſo many more when he was ſcourged; and laſt of all by a ſpeare to haue had ſo much blood let out of his ſide. Yea, by the former doctrine, the blood which he ſhed at his circumciſion had bin enough for all, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:210:35"/> might haue ſaued all the reſt. Yea, ſo indeed in plain words he auoucheth; and for his whole errouious interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion childiſhly playeth with the Latin word <hi>exceſſum</hi> there vſed by the vulgar Latin tranſlation, but not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any thing ſuperfluous, but onely according to the<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 5. 7.</note> Greeke word ſo tranſlated, meaning Chriſts departure or going away, ſpoken of by our Sauiour himſelf, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie before the ſending of the <hi>Comforter:</hi> for the word v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Luke,</hi> ſignifieth onely a going out of the way; and it is the very name of the ſecond booke of <hi>Moſes,</hi> called <hi>Exodus,</hi> becauſe it containeth chiefly the departure of the Iſraelites out of the land of Egypt. But will this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſtand without blaſphemie againſt Gods iuſtice and Chriſts wiſedome? But this ſhall ſuffiſe for the neceſſitie of Chriſts ſufferings, by the way inſerted.</p>

Notwithſtanding, whatſoeuer the naturall ſignification of the word is, yet I confeſſe it is chiefly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ſuch a ſacrifice as the Iews were wont to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and as the heathen alſo offered to their Idols, according to the ſignification of the Greeke word here and elſewhere vſed; yea alſo according to the two Latin words vſed for the ſame, <hi>victima</hi> and <hi>hoſtia.</hi> Here let vs not omit the diſtinction made by learned <hi>Sadael</hi> betwixt<note place="margin">Contra Miſſam.</note> the action of ſacrificing and the thing ſacrificed; and that the word <hi>ſacrifice</hi> more properly is to be vnderſtood of the action (as before I ſaid,) and that the thing ſacrificed was called <hi>hoſtia</hi> or <hi>victima:</hi> hence it is that our ſpirituall and internall worſhip of God, and the duties of pietie &amp; charitie, are called ſacrifices, by the former ſimilitude of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſacrifices in old time. Now the Greek word here vſed, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all one with another <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, both of the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth <hi>mactare,</hi> to kill ſome liuing creature for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:210:36"/> ſome holy vſe in the worſhip and ſeruice of God. And therefore for that that we call, and in the Law was called a ſacrifice, the heathen had thoſe two Latin words before mentioned, <hi>hoſtia</hi> and <hi>victima;</hi> touching the Etymologie whereof, the Poet had two Latin verſes:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Victima quae dextra cecidit victrice vocatur,</l>
                  <l>Hoſtibus à victis, hoſtia nomen habet.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The Dictionaries, <hi>Cooper, Rider, &amp;c.</hi> make this difference betwixt the two ſaid words (yet not according to thoſe verſes) that <hi>hoſtia</hi> was a ſacrifice offered to their ſuppoſed gods at their going forth to warre againſt their enemies; <hi>victima</hi> that which they offered after victorie obtained. In both theſe reſpects we are to preſent our bodies and whole man a ſacrifice to God, both for our victorie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained by Ieſus Chriſt, according to that of the Apoſtle, that <hi>hauing ſpoyled Principalities and powers, he</hi>

                  <hi>made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing ouer them vpon his croſſe;</hi> and according to that, that <hi>aſcending vp on high he led captiuitie captiue:</hi> and alſo to that end, that we may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome<note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 18.

               <p>The reaſon of this phraſe <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> is, becauſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt Ieſus, we are partakers of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and are <hi>Prieſts</hi> as wel as <hi>Kings vnto God.</hi> For though<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 5. Reuel. 1. 6. and 5. 10.</note> in that place of <hi>Peter</hi> we be called alſo <hi>liuing ſtones,</hi> yet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:210:36"/> this is not preiudiciall to the other: for in diuers reſpects we are called by diuers names: and there we be called <hi>ſtones</hi> rather then timber; Firſt, becauſe Princes houſes are rather built with ſtones then with timber, and we be the houſes &amp; temples of God himſelf, who is King of Kings. Secondly, in reſpect of the perpetuitie of all the elect, ſtones being more durable then timber. Thirdly, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe, into whom (as before I ſaid) we are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, is alſo called <hi>the chiefe corner ſtone.</hi> In like maner as<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 20.</note> Chriſt was both the Prieſt and alſo the ſacrifice once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for all, ſo are we both Prieſts and alſo ſacrifices, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this preſent text.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:210:37"/> contrary to our deſert.</p>
               <p>Let vs alſo further vnderſtand, that this our ſacrifice<note place="margin">Our ſacrifice of our ſelues twofold, actiue and palsiue.</note> of our whole man, bodie and ſoule, is twofold: Firſt, actiue: Secondly, paſſiue.

               <p>Touching the Prieſts of the Law, they were all of one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Tribe, viz. of the Tribe of <hi>Leui;</hi> and not all they, but only the poſteritie of <hi>Aaron:</hi> neither all the poſteritie of <hi>Aaron;</hi> for there were excepted from the ſeruice of the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>all that were blind, lame, flat noſed, or that had any thing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leuit. 21. ver. 18 19, 20, 21.</note>

               <p>Touching the place, after the building of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all ſacrifices of the Law were onely to be offered in the Tabernacle, and after the building of the Temple all in the Temple, the Tabernacle it ſelfe before the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, being called by the name of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.<note place="margin">1.

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:210:37"/> here exhorteth theſe Romanes to offer.</p>
               <p>Touching the third difference before mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the ſacrifices of the Law and this and Other therein<note place="margin">Leuit. 23.</note> contained; there were ſet times for the ſacrifices of the Law, viz. morning and euening; ſometimes alſo the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were doubled, twice as much being commanded to be offered at one time as at another; yea there were alſo ſet &amp; ſeuerall ſacrifices enioyned at for ſeueral feaſts of the Lord. Now in the time of the Goſpell there is no ſuch ſet time appointed for this ſacrifice of our ſelues; but as we are to <hi>pray alwayes</hi> and <hi>without ceaſing,</hi> as well as <hi>euery</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 18. 1. Theſ. 5. 17. 1. Tim. 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>where</hi> (this dutie of prayer being a branch, as we ſhal heare of this ſacrifice of our ſelues,) ſo we are alwayes and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to offer this ſacrifice of our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Touching the perſons for whom the old ſacrifices were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to be offered, there was one ſacrifice for the Prieſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note place="margin">Leuit. 4. 3.</note> for the ſinne of the whole congregation, another for the magiſtrate, another for any of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that alſo according to the qualitie of euery ones ſinne; for the ſinnes of <hi>knowledge,</hi> a greater ſacrifice being enioyned then for the ſinnes of <hi>ignorance.</hi> But now the ſpirituall ſacrifices of the Goſpell, comprehended in this ſacrifice of our ſelues, muſt be offered for all alike, as well as by all alike; the neglect of this ſacrifice or of any ſuch branch thereof, as whereof afterward we ſhall ſpeake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preiudiciall to all the whole bodie whereof we are members, as well as to the partie himſelfe that ſo neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus ſpoken of theſe differences of the old ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Law and of this of our ſelues, let vs now returne to our former dictinction of ſacrificing our ſelues both actiuely and paſſiuely. To begin therefore with the actiue ſacrificing of our ſelues, becauſe the Apoſtle (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath bin ſhewed) by our <hi>bodies</hi> meaneth our whole man, bodie and ſoule, and yet nameth onely our bodies; let vs in that reſpect begin with the actiue ſacrificing of our bodies, and then ſpeak of the ſacrificing of our ſoules;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:210:38"/> and of both as briefly as we may.</p>
               <p>Touching our bodies; I may firſt of all conſider the<note place="margin">The actiue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of our bodies.</note> ſacrificing of our heads, wherein let vs onely remember that ſober and modeſt wearing of our haire, which the Apoſtle (by the teſtimonie of nature it ſelfe) commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 14. 15</note> vnto vs, namely, that <hi>men weare ſhort haire,</hi> becauſe it is a ſhame for them to haue long haire; and that women likewiſe account of their long ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re to be an ornament vnto them, and on the contrary that it is a ſhame for them to be ſhauen or polled. Theſe premiſes do plainly ſhew firſt of all, that all men that accordingly do not ſo weare their haire, do not therefore ſacrifice their heads ſo vnto God as here the Apoſtle commandeth: for what is it to ſacrifice our bodies and euery member of them, but to frame and conforme them according to the word, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we ſhal heare more at large. The ſame is to be ſaid of women, either impudently cutting off their haire, and ſo making themſelues like to beardleſſe yong men, or not wearing their haire in ſuch modeſtie as the word preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. But of theſe things more afterward vpon the ſecond verſe.</p>
               <p>To come now to the particular members of our heads.<note place="margin">Our eares.</note> Our eares are to be ſacrificed to God, firſt by reſtraining them from hearing any falſe doctrine.

               <p>As we muſt turne away our eares from all falſe doctrine,<note place="margin">Epheſ 4. 29. Epheſ. 5. 4. 1.

Hitherto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth that graue admonition to the Hebrewes, before by the Apoſtle commended to haue had <hi>ſuch things as did</hi>

And alas who ſeeth not the neceſſitie of this admonition in theſe dayes, and in this our land, not onely by the ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theſe Romiſh and bloody caterpillers before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but alſo by their perillous effects in many like children of diſobedience, euen by the falling away of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Poperie, that haue bin borne of Proteſtant parents and inſtructed in the truth?

               <p>Touching other particular parts of our bodies, I ſhall not need to ſpeake of the ſacrificing of them, the former parts being the principall, by that which hath bin ſaid of them, we may haue direction for the reſt.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:210:43"/> to be applied vnto, and that alſo in ſuch maner as the Lord hath preſcribed.

               <p>In all that hitherto I haue ſaid of the actiue ſacrificing of thoſe former members of our bodies, that I may not ſeeme too ſingular in particularizing thoſe former parts of our bodies, let it be conſidered that I haue but troden<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Rom. 12. 1. and tom. 1. pag. 980. in Pſal. 150.</note> in the ſteps of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> who writeth thus: <hi>Quomodo corpus hoſtia? nihil mali reſpiciat oculus, &amp; factus eſt hoſtia: nil turpe loquatur lingua, &amp; facta eſt oblatio, &amp;c. How is our bodie a ſacrifice? let thine eye behold no euill, and it is made a ſacrifice: let thy tongue ſpeake no filthineſſe, and it is made an oblation: let thy hand commit no inquitie, and it is made a burnt offering. Imo non ſufficiunt iſta, ſed bonorum nobis &amp; ſtudio &amp; lucro opus eſt, &amp;c. Yea, let not theſe things ſuffice, but we haue need alſo of a deſire and of the benefit of doing good, namely, that the hand giue almes, that with the mouth we bleſſe them that raile on vs, that our hearing do continually attend to diuine words. For a ſacrifice hath no vncleanneſſe, it comprehendeth the firſt fruits of all other: and therefore let vs render vnto God the firſt fruits of our hands, of our feete, of our mouth, as well as of all our other parts, ſuch a ſacrifice pleaſeth God, when in the meane time the ſacrifices of the Iewes are vncleane.</hi> And againe, <hi>when we haue mortified our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, then we ſhall begin to liue. For this is a new law of this our ſacrifice: and therefore here is a maruellous kind of fire; for we haue no need either of wood or of any other ſuch ſubiect matter, but our fire liueth in it ſelfe, not burning the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>

               <p>He alſo obſerueth that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>Make your bodies a ſacrifice,</hi> but <hi>preſent them;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>Haue no thing to do with them, ſith ye haue beſtowed them vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another.</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:210:44"/> This he illuſtrateth by this ſimilitude, namely, that <hi>they that beſtow horſes of warre vpon another, haue nothing to do with them afterward: ſo he that hath beſtowed his members for warre againſt the diuell, euen a terrible warre, may not afterward recall them, and conuert them to his proper vſe.</hi> Hereby alſo he ſheweth vs another thing, that <hi>we muſt firſt trie them, foraſmuch as we preſent them to another. For we do not preſent them to any earthly perſon but to him that is God of all; not onely to warre with them, but that they may haue the King himſelfe as it were to be their rider: for he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth not to ſit on our members, but greatly deſireth it. And that which a King that is our fellow ſeruant will not, the ſame doth he deſire that is Lord of the Angels. Becauſe therefore thy members are to be preſented to God (to be a ſacrifice) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purge them of euery blemiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if they haue any blemiſh, they are no ſacrifice. For the eye may not be offered, that is a ſeruant to fornication; nor the hand that is a taker and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; nor the feet that halt or frequent Playes; nor the belly that is giuen to dainties, and inflameth the deſires of pleaſure; nor the heart that nouriſheth wrath or vnchaſte loue; nor the tongue that ſpeaketh filthy things.

               <p>But in all hitherto noted out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> it is to be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:210:44"/> obſerued, that there is no mention of one part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that in theſe dayes is moſt abuſed, to Gods great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour: neither indeed could there be any mention thereof, either by <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> or by any other, neither then liuing, or afterward in any age, till this laſt and moſt wicked age of all other. But what part of the bodie is that? Our very noſtrils. Why? How can that be made a ſacrifice now to God? According to other things before noted out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> by refraining the ſame from that foule and monſtrous abuſe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> that is now ſo common in all ſorts, in Church and Commonwealth, in the Vniuerſities themſelues, in the Innes of Court, in Gentlemen, in Yeomen, in Clownes; what ſhall I ſay more, the very rogues and vagabonds now haue got it: yea, being committed to cages, and laid by the heeles in the ſtocks, while they are thus vnder puniſhment of the magiſtrate, ſo impudent are they, that euen then &amp; there they haue their Tobacco-boxes and Tobacco-pipes, and make the ſmoke of hell fornace to come out of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, in the ſight of all ſtanding about their ſaid cages, and gazing on them, while they ſo ſit in the ſtocks. Oh wofull, oh lamentable! Moſt of all wofull and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it, that yet for all this, others that ſhould be and would be of ſome ſort and faſhion, ſhould ſtill continue the foule abuſe of it. Is it not, as it is vſed, the nurſe and nouriſhment of drunkenneſſe? Can any ſhew as many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it, as all men ſee inconueniences? Verily though it may be it is good for ſome thing, yet if the common ſaying be true, Better a miſchiefe then an inconuenience, it were better it were quite ſuppreſt and cleane hiſt out of the kingdome, in reſpect of the manifold detriments and inconueniences by it, then ſtill to be retained. Alas, alas, that men, yea and men of vnderſtanding, ſhould be ſo inchanted and bewitched with it. Strange faſhions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the higher ranke of men, do ceaſe and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne by ſuch as firſt began them, when euery baſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the country hath laid hold of them: how ſtrange

               <p>Touching our affections, they muſt likewiſe be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated<note place="margin">To ſacrifice our affections.</note> and ſacrificed vnto God: otherwiſe being ſuffered to haue their ſwinge, they many times ouer-rule wit, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vnderſtanding, iudgement, thoughts, memorie and will. That theſe our affections therefore, loue, hatred, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c. may be ſacrificed, this is firſt to be obſerued, that they attend vpon the former and higher powers of the ſoule, wit, reaſon, vnderſtanding, &amp;c. and that they be not ſuffered in any caſe to dominiere ouer them, or to go without them. They muſt not go before them, but follow after them, and be directed by them. Therefore euen tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching loue, the moſt principall affection of all the reſt, the Apoſtle will haue it <hi>to abound in knowledge and in all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 1. 9.</note> Without knowledge and iudgment, we may and wil loue either too much or too little; yea we cannot but ſo do. Knowledge and iudgement (this iudgement is the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:210:48"/> application of knowledge vnto particulars) muſt direct our loue both touching the obiect thereof, and alſo tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the meaſure thereof. The firſt and moſt chiefe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37. &amp;c.</note> of our loue, is God himſelfe: the next is our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The one is not to be loued without the other. Yet God is moſt to be loued, and that for himſelfe: our neighbour for God. In both theſe our loue may erre without direction from knowledge and iudgement. By God himſelfe we meane his word alſo, and all his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: for he that loueth not theſe, loueth not God; and ſuch as our loue to God is, ſuch will be our regard alſo<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 18.</note> to theſe. By our neighbour alſo, our ſelues are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, becauſe our loue to our ſelues is the rule of our loue to our neighbour: for ſo it is ſaid in the former place, and in the law. And although our loue to God cannot be too great in reſpect of the meaſure, yea, not anſwerable to the meaſure, yet it may ſwarue in reſpect of the effects: namely, when our loue to God ſhall be ſuch, that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth vs beyond his word; and not thinking the word to containe duties enough, we ſhall do more then the word requireth; and hence commeth all ſuperſtition. But I may not thus amply diſcourſe of euery affection.</p>
               <p>Our hatred is ſacrificed to God, when it is bent againſt<note place="margin">Hatred.</note> all that God hateth, and when we hate no further then we haue warrant from the word of God. The ſame is to be ſaid of our anger, envie, feare, griefe, ioy, &amp;c. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of theſe and all other our affections, muſt be ſuch as the word warranteth, and no other. Neither muſt the cauſe, meaſure or time exceed the rule of the word for them. They muſt be employed for God, not againſt God. They muſt all be directed by God and by his word, not by man, or by the word or will of any man, of ourſelues, or of any other.</p>
               <p>In this ſacrificing of our affections, let vs eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſacrifice our ſorrow and griefe, in mourning for, and lamenting and bewailing our ſinnes, according to the number and greatneſſe of them, as alſo our long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

All that we do or can do vnto God, yea much more alſo, we do owe vnto God.

In the foreſaid Chapter alſo of <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 7. 8 9.</note> our Sauiour had before taught, that a mans ſeruant meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing at the hands of his maſter, by doing that that his maſter had commanded him. If therefore the ſeruant of a man cannot merit any thing at the hands of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by doing his commandements, who notwithſtanding is his fellow-ſeruant vnto God; how alas can any man me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit any good at the hands of God by keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements? yea, that cannot ſo keepe them, but that he breaketh many of them, and faileth alſo much in his beſt keeping of any of them? If alſo mens ſeruants cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo much of their maſters as a little libertie for a while, as our Sauiour in the ſame place teacheth; how much leſſe can they deſerue to be made their heires, by doing that which their maſters commanded them? Leaſt of all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can any man deſerue to be made the heire of God and of his kingdome in heauen, though he could do all for matter and maner that God hath commanded him. If we cannot merit by ſuffering of martyrdome, how much leſſe can we merit by doing any thing elſe? The kingdome of heauen is not the hire of any works or ſufferings, but Gods reward of his meere grace. Thus and no otherwiſe are all thoſe places to be vnderſtood, that ſpeake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, namely, that they are rewards of mercie, not of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: or if of merit, onely of Chriſts merit in Gods mercie

The Turkie cocke is a great fowle, and maketh a great bruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſtrouting with his wings; yea, he will alſo fight Iuſtily a few blowes: but a little dunghill cocke will for all that at the laſt driue him away, and make him to hide his head in a hole, and neuer dare to fight blow more. So is it with many Chriſtians; they will be very hot before perſecution cometh, and perhaps very ſharply condemne them that in weakneſſe yeeld: but when perſecution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and themſelues are called into the field, alas what cowards do they proue? how do they ſhrinke? yea, how fouly ſometimes do they <hi>palinodiam canere,</hi> and turne cat in pan, and become themſelues perſecuters of other? Oh therefore let all men beware of ſuch craking before and of ſuch preſumption.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the former holy feare, let vs be much in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> prayer to God, that he may ſtrengthen vs, and make vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtand in the euill day; and let vs put on not ſome parts, but the whole armour of God, preſcribed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 11. &amp;c.</note> to the Epheſians. If but any peece thereof want, all the reſt will do vs little good: yea, the truth is, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:210:59"/> we cannot put on one peece, except we put on all.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, let vs wel labour the mortifying of our old man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that our outward man may the better beare &amp; go through with all troubles for our Lord Chriſts ſake. Let vs ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice our ſelues, both actiuely in all things before ſpoken of, and alſo paſſiuely in the firſt kind of our paſſiue ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of our ſelues as before we haue heard; and then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we ſhall the more eaſily and ioyfully ſacrifice our ſelues and all that we haue in this ſecond paſſiue kinde. Souldiers trained for the time of warre, againſt the time of warre, are the fitter for warre whenſoeuer the ſame ſhall come. In the time of warre alſo, by little skirmiſhes men are the better fleſht for the great and maine battell. So is it, ſo it will be with men for the time of perſecution. The more they skirmiſh with their affections, &amp;c. and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the ſame, the more they labour in the actiue ſacrificing themſelues, as alſo the more patiently they can beare pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate wrongs and iniuries, and other pettie afflictions, the fitter they ſhall be for the day of greater triall. He that cannot beare a light burden, how ſhall he beare an heauie? Herein alſo (to ſpeake of one particular branch of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actiue ſacrificing of our ſelues) let vs conſider how franke and forward we haue bin with our purſes, both in our almes and giuing to the poore, as alſo in any worke requiring coſt and charge for the maintenance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell For certainly he that in ſuch cauſes is ſparing of his purſe, and pinching of his mony, how ſhall he not but be much more ſparing of his blood? He alſo that hath bin cold, and not bold to ſpeake for Chriſt, when occaſion hath required that he ſhould haue ſpoken, how ſhall his heart faile and faint to lay downe his life for Chriſts ſake?</p>
               <p>In all the ſacrificing of our ſelues before ſpoken, of actiue and paſſiue, let vs alwayes remember to do all and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all, onely to God, and for God.

               </argument>
               <p>THe adiuncts of this ſacrifice are three, 1. <hi>liuing; 2. holy; 3. acceptable.</hi> There is alſo a fourth, <hi>your reaſonable ſeruice:</hi> but this being more then an adiunct, euen a poſt argument (as I may ſpeake) for confimation of the maine exhortation, I do not therefore reckon it with the reſt.</p>
               <p>Touching theſe three, the laſt is both an effect and alſo an end of the two firſt. An effect, becauſe if the ſacrifice be <hi>liuing</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> it cannot but be <hi>acceptable.</hi> An end, becauſe we muſt not offer our ſelues a ſacrifice <hi>liuing</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> to pleaſe men, to get credit to our ſelues, or to make any other gaine thereby for this life, but to be acceptable to God, to pleaſe God. As before the Apoſtle had ſet downe the ſubſtance of our ſacrifice to be our bodies, yea our whole ſelues, ſoules and bodies, as hath bin ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo now in the two firſt adiuncts here annexed he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the qualitie. As before he had ſet downe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:210:60"/> what we muſt offer; ſo now he ſetteth downe what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſacrifice our ſaid ſacrifice muſt be, viz, <hi>liuing</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>acceptable.</hi>

For as when God is called <hi>the liuing God,</hi> by the Apoſtles and by the high Prieſt, the meaning is, that he liueth for euer, and is immutable and vnchangeable: and as the Spirit of God which Chriſt promiſeth to all that ſhall come vnto him and beleeue in him, is called by the name of <hi>riuers of liuing water,</hi> that is, ſuch as ſhould<note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 38.</note> neuer be dried vp; as alſo before that to the woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 10.</note> by the name of <hi>liuing water,</hi> and is more plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be ſuch, that <hi>whoſoeuer ſhould drinke thereof</hi>

If any that ſeeme to be liuing do die, he neuer indeed was aliue, but ſeemed onely ſo to be. He that is once truly a liuing ſacrifice, ſo will be to the end. He can no more loſe this his ſpirituall life, then God himſelfe or Chriſt Ieſus can die: becauſe that his life is the life of God and of Chriſt Ieſus. O vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable comfort!</p>
               <p>This life of our ſacrifice, muſt not be concealed for feare of any danger whatſoeuer; yea, it cannot be concealed: where it is, it will ſhew it ſelfe by the effects and workes

Sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they that are thus liuing, do not themſelues feele this life in themſelues, but feare they haue it not, as being for a time in a ſpirituall ſwoune, and oppreſſed either with their ſinnes, or with many afflictions: yea, ſometimes their eyes are ſo dazeled with the great proſperitie of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that they thinke their ſtate better then their owne, as thinking all to be in vaine that they haue done in <hi>cleanſing</hi>

Doth not the Apoſtle thereby manifeſtly ſhew that our faith cannot periſh; elſe were the argument of the Apoſtle from the compariſon thereof with gold, of no force.</p>
               <p>All hitherto ſpoken of this attribute <hi>liuing,</hi> here giuen to this our ſacrifice, is to be applied to all before ſaid of our actiue and paſſiue ſacrificing of our ſelues, we muſt do all, we muſt ſuffer all with all alacritie and cheerfulnes, as alſo with all conſtancie and ſtedfaſtneſſe. That which is ſaid of a liberall perſon, that <hi>the Lord loueth a cheerfull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 9. 7.</note> is to be vnderſtood of the actiue and paſſiue ſacrificing of our ſelues. If we muſt be cheerfull in giuing vnto men, muſt we not much more be cheerfull in ſacrificing our ſelues to God, that in many reſpects hath right vnto our ſelues, and to all that we haue? All the actiue ſacrificing of our bodies, and of euery member of them; as alſo of our ſoules and of euery power and facultie of them, muſt be cheerfull. So muſt likewiſe be all our paſſiue ſacrificing of our ſelues. The more honorable alſo it is to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, the more willing and cheerfull ſhould we be to part from all, yea to lay downe our liues for his ſake. And indeed whoſoeuer hath truly beleeued that Chriſt hath ſo willingly and cheerfully ſuffered thoſe direful tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for vs that he did, he cannot but be willing and cheerfull alſo to ſuffer any thing for him. Oh that this <hi>life</hi> were in euery one that pretendeth to ſacrifice himſelfe to God. In things that concerne our ſelues for this life, how liuely, how nimble are we? but alas in ſacrificing our ſelues
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:210:64"/> to God, in doing or ſuffering any thing for God, how drowſie, how dead, how leaden heeled and handed are we?</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of conſtancie in ſacrificing our ſelues both actiuely and paſſiuely. It is not enough to ſuffer a little, or at once; but if we ſhould be called often to ſuffer for his truth, it ſhould not be grieuous vnto vs. Though we ſhould be firſt reuiled touching our good names, then ſpoiled of all our good, then laid vp in priſon, and there kept with great hardneſſe for many yeares; then brought out to execution, and to haue our fleſh torne from our backs by peece-meale, as ſome haue had; or be burnt by little and little, as <hi>William Gardiner</hi> Merchant was beyond the ſeas; yet none of all theſe ought to make any of vs to ſhrinke.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:210:68"/> purging themſelues before the receiuing of them? Who is ſo fooliſh as to put precious licour into a fuſtie veſſell? Neither muſt this cleanſing of our ſelues be for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent onely, afterward <hi>returning with the dog to the vomit,</hi>

                  <hi>and with the ſwine vnto the mire;</hi> but we muſt ſo keep our ſelues: and the oftener we heare the word and receiue the Sacrament, the more holy euery day muſt we be.</p>
               <p>All this our holineſſe muſt be in humilitie: without humilitie, there is no holineſſe. The more humble we be, the more capable are we of the knowledge of the word,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25 9.</note> and of comfort by the Sacrament, yea alſo by prayers.<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 14. 1.

                  <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giueth grace to the humble. The Lord filleth the hungrie with good things, and the rich</hi> (in their owne conceit) <hi>he ſendeth emptie away,</hi> euen from word, from Sacraments, from prayer. <hi>He that thinketh</hi>

                  <hi>he knoweth any thing, knoweth nothing as he ought to know.</hi> Oh that this were well conſidered of. For certainly many great profeſſors are ſo ouer-weened and puft vp with a conceit of their owne knowledge, that they thinke no man can teach them any thing that they know not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: yea ſome are like to thoſe the Prophet ſaid, <hi>did ſtriue</hi>

                  <hi>with the Prieſt;</hi> ſo (I ſay) ſome are more ready to ſnap at that which is ſaid by the Miniſter, and to find fault with and controll the ſame, as thinking themſelues could ſpeak better, then in humilitie and meekneſſe of mind to learne any thing.</p>
               <p>As the former <hi>life</hi> is of God, ſo is this <hi>holineſſe.</hi> Chriſt<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 17.</note> prayed the Father to worke it <hi>through his truth:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus alſo to be <hi>holy</hi> is a work of Faith as well as to be <hi>liuing.</hi> For, <hi>our hearts are purified</hi> (or <hi>ſanctified) by faith.</hi>

So alſo the great and manifold iudgements of God againſt Iuda and Ieruſalem for their abuſing of the Prophets, and<note place="margin">2.

Later times do affoord vs many examples of Gods heauy hand againſt many perſecuting Papiſts in other countries and in our owne of the Lords holy profeſſors of the Goſpell, and ſuch as deſired well to pleaſe him. The yeare alſo 88. and the powder treaſon do plentifully ſhew the truth of the premiſes.

               <p>Now although I haue hitherto ſpoken of this adiunct <hi>well pleaſing,</hi> as amplified by the ſubiect to whom the ſame is well pleaſing viz <hi>to God;</hi> yet there is no abſurditie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the ſame to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole exhortation, &amp; to euery branch thereof.

Much more therefore ought we by this reaſon to be encouraged to preſent our ſelues a ſacrifice liuing and holy to God, becauſe ſuch a ſacrifice is well pleaſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Yea, the more carefull ought we to be of ſo doing, in conſideration both of our former, and alſo of our daily ſinnes, whereby we iuſtly deſerue his euerlaſting diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But hauing thus largely hitherto ſpoken of theſe words <hi>well pleaſing to God,</hi> both as another ſeueral adiunct of our former ſacrifice, and alſo as a reaſon to moue vs the more willingly to preſent the ſame liuing and holy to God; what is the vſe of all that hath bin ſaid hereof? That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all ſpoken of preſenting our ſelues a ſacrifice in bodie and<note place="margin">The vſe of the former doctrine</note> ſoule, actiue and paſſiue vnto God, muſt be referred to this end, that therein we may be well pleaſing to God. It is no matter for pleaſing of men, except by pleaſing of them we do alſo pleaſe God. If by doing of that wherein we pleaſe God, we diſpleaſe men, yea all the men in the world (if that were poſſible) that alſo is no matter. For <hi>if God be</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By the coniunction of this with the former, we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> taught theſe two points: firſt, that onely they that are holy do well pleaſe God: ſecondly, that all that are holy are well pleaſing, acceptable and gracious vnto God. Onely they that are holy, and all they that are holy are in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>in whom God is well pleaſed.</hi> Onely they that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all that are holy haue faith, <hi>whereby the heart is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>When we know our ſelues to be in grace with God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and to pleaſe him, then may we aſſure our ſelues that whatſoeuer we performe vnto God, or ſuffer for God, is well pleaſing to God. As the ſacrifice of the wicked is abominable to God; ſo the ſacrifice of euery one that is liuing and holy, is well pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch alſo as before we haue heard, how many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> wayes it appeareth that the Lords holies or Saints are well pleaſing vnto him, by their manifold priuiledges and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:210:72"/> prerogatiues whereby the Lord teſtifieth the ſame; how ſhould this prouoke and quicken all men, and as it were ſet their teeth on edge to be of that number. The more bountifull any Prince, Nobleman or other great perſon is to his ſeruants, the more ſuters haue ſuch by themſelues or by other to be entertained by them: yea, the more bountifully ſuch perſons reward ſuch as are ſent with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents vnto them, the more forward is euery one to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with ſuch gifts vnto them. When therefore we heare how well pleaſed God is with ſuch as preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſuch a ſacrifice vnto him, is it not a wonder that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould be backward in doing hereof?</p>
               <p>If God alſo be ſo well pleaſed with vs, in whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> there remaneth ſo much corruption, and with whom in many reſpects he may be diſpleaſed; how ſhould this prouoke our loue vnto him? euen ſo, that we ſhould thinke nothing too hot or to heauie for him: yea, be ready to runne through fire and water whereby to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any ſeruice vnto him. But of this before. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we cannot almoſt ſufficiently deplore and lament the coldneſſe of men in theſe times, that require ſo much zeale, ſo much feruencie. Men feare more to ſpeake a few words, to take a little paines, to be at charge in laying out a little dirtie mony for Gods truth and ſeruants; yea, to ſpeake a word for the one or the other againſt the Roman and other enemies of God and of his Church, then thoſe three Worthies of <hi>Dauid</hi> before mentioned, were to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their liues for a ſmall matter in <hi>Dauids</hi> behalfe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, how willing ſhould this former conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> make all men to be, to entertaine ſuch into their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie, to make them of their deareſt acquaintance by mariage or otherwiſe; to haue them into their families; ſith by one ſuch many contrary minded do fare ſo much the better?</p>
               <p>Sith alſo the Lord doth ſo take the parts of ſuch his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that oftentimes he doth moſt ſeuerely purſue many and great ones that do any of them the leaſt wrong; how

The like is to be ſaid of all the powers and faculties of the ſoule, though ſo oppreſt by the infirmitie of the bodie, that they cannot ſhew themſelues, as afterward in better ſtrength of the bodie they do. As it is in the naturall birth of man, ſo alſo is it in his ſupernaturall and ſpirituall birth. They that are regenerated, are fully regenerated. As the naturall childe notwithſtanding once borne, groweth in ſtature, naturall knowledge, ſtrength, &amp;c. ſo doth the new borne ſpiritually, grow in heauenly knowledge, ſauing grace &amp; godlineſſe, yet according to the meaſure of grace.

Neither at this day doth any man commit murder or any other the like ſin, of any power that he hath ſo to do, but of the power of Satan, ſo weakning ſuch ſinners in <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt, that they haue no power to reſiſt the tentations of Satan vnto any ſinne.

Yea, from men alſo they may haue power and commiſſion to perſecute the Saints (as <hi>Paul</hi> had from the high Prieſts to perſecute all whom<note place="margin">Act. 9. 2. chap. 22. 4.</note> he could find profeſſing Chriſt,) but there is no lawfull power but of God.

Notwithſtanding as freedome is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to coaction and conſtraint, ſo they may be ſaid to do all their euill freely, becauſe no man ſinneth by conſtraint and againſt his will, but euery man willingly. It were no ſinne, if it were not willing. Neither can the will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. Will conſtrained, is no will. There can be no two things more contrary then will and conſtraint. Will is within a man; conſtraint is without.</p>

                  <hi>morning, and offered burnt offerings according to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> For this was a principall meanes whereby they might be ſanctified, for the obtaining of pardon of whatſoeuer ſinne they had committed in their mutuall feaſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hard to feaſt without ſinne; alſo, that pardon thereof obtained, they might haue more grace of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation afterward.

Now to conclude, the anſwer to this obiection, ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations as this is and other, are the meanes both to giue life to them that are dead in their ſinnes, and alſo to preſerue life where by ſuch exhortations it was before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: yea alſo by the ſame to diſcouer their corruptions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and to quicken them to labour for more grace for reformation of them.

               </argument>
               <p>NOw followeth the laſt words of this firſt verſe, and the fourth argument for enforcing the former whole exhortation of preſenting our bodies <hi>a ſacrifice liuing, holy and well pleaſing to God.</hi> This argument is in the words commonly tranſlated and read, <hi>your reaſonable ſeruing</hi> or <hi>ſeruice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are theſe words onely a confirmation of the foreſaid exhortation, but alſo an amplification of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer three adiuncts of the ſacrifice to be preſented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Touching the words themſelues, the common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and reading of them hath ſeemed not onely hard, but ſomewhat ſtrange alſo vnto me, namely, that it ſhould be tranſlated <hi>reaſonable.</hi> For I could neuer ſee any ſufficient reaſon for the ſaid interpretation. The word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from whence it is deuided ſignifieth <hi>reaſon,</hi> at leaſt in other writers; but it can hardly be ſhewed ſo to ſignifie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Teſtament. The compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thereof with a priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue particle ſignifieth <hi>vnreaſonable,</hi> as beaſts are, and ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude:</hi> yet the ſimple word I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<note place="margin">2.

               <p>The reaſon of the common tranſlation of this word, hath bin from the oppoſition of this ſacrifice of our ſelues to the ſacrifices of the Law, all offered of vnreaſonable creatures: but the word <hi>your ſeruice</hi> here interpoſed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this reaſon of no great force.</p>
               <p>Other ſay, that this our ſacrifice is called <hi>reaſonable,</hi> by oppoſition likewiſe to the former old ſacrifices, but in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reſpect, namely, becauſe there could be no reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the former old ſacrifices, why the Lord required ſo many beaſts to be ſacrificed, but there may be and is great reaſon of ſacrificing our ſelues. But this reaſon is vnreaſonable, and contrary to all truth. For who is ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as not to know, the former ſacrifices to haue bin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to foreſignifie and foreſhew the death of Chriſt: as alſo to teach, that we had deſerued to die. Are theſe no reaſons?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> commeth neareſt to the truth, and to that that I intend, though he do not ſo fully lay it open, as were to be wiſhed he had done. Theſe are his words, <hi>Rationalis cultus, eſt ſpiritualis ſeruitus; ratio viuendi iuxta Chriſti in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituta:</hi> Our reaſonable worſhip, is our ſpirituall ſeruice; the maner of liuing according to Chriſts inſtitutions.

Of this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am the more fully perſwaded, becauſe the very like words are ſo interpreted by all other, and cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted<note place="margin">1.

                  </gap>ſoeuer Engliſh that I know, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete this of <hi>Peter, the milke of the word.</hi> Why therefore ſhould this place to the Romanes be tranſlated either in Latin <hi>rationalem cultum,</hi> or in Engliſh <hi>your reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,</hi> and not rather <hi>the ſeruice of the word?</hi> And this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of mine accordeth with that (as I ſaid) of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, iuxta Chriſti inſtituta,</hi> according to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt. For <hi>according to Chriſts inſtitutions,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word,</hi> is all one. By this my interpretation, notwithſtanding different from the former, I do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together infringe or controll the common tranſlation, <hi>your reaſonable ſeruice;</hi> eſpecially if we vnderſtand the word <hi>reaſonable</hi> as oftentimes it is taken in our Engliſh tongue for that that is iuſt and equall. For ſuch things we ſay are reaſonable. Thus my interpretation of theſe words <hi>your ſeruice of the word,</hi> is nothing different from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>your reaſonable ſeruice.</hi> For as it is reaſonable that ſubiects ſhould obey their Soueraignes, and children their parents, and ſeruants their maſters, according to the lawes, orders and directions of ſuch Soueraignes, parents and maſters, and not of other: ſo and much more it ſtandeth with all reaſon, that all men, of what ranke and degree ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, ſhould ſerue the Lord according to this owne word, or, according to <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> owne word, <hi>according to the inſtitutions of Chriſt</hi> from God giuen vnto vs; and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens owne deuices, or to the doctrines and traditions of any other.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing interpreted the words, and proued my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation by the ſignification of the adiectiue here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and by the like place of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiue is vſed, and by all men ſo interpreted as I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted here; let vs a little more amply ſpeake of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe, both as it is the confirmation of the former
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:210:79"/> maine exhortation, and as alſo this fourth adiunct <hi>your ſeruice of the word</hi> is the meanes whereby our ſaid ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice of our ſelues is made liuing, holy, and well pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, the whole argument is this: That ſeruice that God hath required in his word, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto him: But God requireth in his word this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that we ſhould preſent our ſelues a ſacrifice liuing, holy and well pleaſing vnto him: Therefore this ſacrifice is to be preſented vnto him. If any man ſhall think theſe words to be rather a confirmation of the laſt former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct of this ſacrifice, <hi>well pleaſing to God,</hi> it commeth to the ſame paſſe. For the confirmation of this one branch of the exhortation, is the confirmation of all.</p>
               <p>The propoſition or firſt part of this argument, viz. that that ſeruice that God requireth in his word, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto him, or is well pleaſing vnto him. This (I ſay) is ſo euident, that it needeth no further proofe or ſpeech, but onely this, that whatſoeuer is contrary to the word, or more then the word requireth, in matter or in maner, is abominable to the Lord, and reiected by the Lord, with this deniall thereof, <hi>Who required this at your hands?</hi> And<note place="margin">Iſay. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moreouer, the former propoſition is manifeſt by the perfection of the word, to <hi>conuert the ſoule,</hi> to <hi>giue wiſdome</hi>

This word eſpecially being now euery way ſo perfect as it is, and as we ſhall againe in this treatiſe haue occaſion to ſhew it to be? Is it not further ſaid, that <hi>theſe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>things are written to make vs beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God, and that beleeuing we might haue life through his name?</hi> If by thoſe things that are written we may haue faith whereby to haue eternall life, what would we more? or what need we more?

               <p>This word of God in the former reſpects is often called by the name of the bare word, for the excellencie of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all words; no other word or words whatſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be compared thereunto, neither able ſo to quicken and ſanctifie vs, and to make vs pleaſing to God, but this.

                  <p>Containing an entrance into the ſecond verſe: and firſt of all, of not faſhioning our ſelues vnto this world.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw I come to the ſecond verſe; wherein let vs firſt remember, that it containeth an amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the maine exhortation before handled, by an argument taken from a diuers or contrary thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and then that the ſaid diuers or contrary thing is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by another contrary, which is likewiſe amplified by the meanes and by the end. The firſt is in theſe words, <hi>And be not faſhioned</hi> (or <hi>conformed) vnto this world:</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in theſe words, <hi>But be ye transformed, &amp;c.</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, let vs firſt examine the words; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the matter: both as briefly as may be.</p>
               <p>The words are chiefly two: the verbe, <hi>be not faſhioned;</hi> and the nowne, <hi>to this world.</hi> The ſecond notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is the more principall of the two, becauſe it is diuerſly taken in the Scripture: and yet I will not ſpeake of all the ſignifications, becauſe that were needleſſe and idle; but onely of ſuch as make moſt for my preſent purpoſe. In the tongue of the Apoſtle, there be two words, both tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated the world: the one is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But here two queſtions are briefly to be anſwered: Firſt, Why the godly are called by the name of the world? Secondly, Why the wicked are ſo alſo called; both being contrary the one to the other?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that the godly are ſo called, becauſe they<note place="margin">Why the godly are called by the name of the world.</note> indeed are the principalleſt parts of the whole world, though they be the feweſt.

               <p>The godly are the onely Free men and Princes of the world: the wicked are no better then ſeruants, and ſlaues and bond-men to the diuell, to the world, to the wicked luſts of their owne hearts. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>I haue</hi>

                  <item>ſecondly, bodily.</item>

               <p>By ſprituall conformitie, I meane conformitie in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſinnes, both of mind and affections, and alſo of the outward man; and that in matters both of the firſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the ſecond Table.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:210:95"/>
               <p>By conformitie in apparent ſinnes of the minde and affections, I vnderſtand all conſent with the world in any hereſies or other errors, either of Poperie, or of any other ſuch doctrine, onely becauſe men of the world, our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or other friends haue bin of ſuch mind, and haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and died in ſuch hereſies and errors.</p>
               <p>The ſame I ſay of being conformable to the world, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or other, in the outward tranſgreſſion of any of the commandements, that concerne the worſhip of God, or duties to men. As to pray to Saints, to worſhip images, crucifixes and other, to adore the bread and wine in the Supper of the Lord, to obſerue dayes, to refraine from meates allowed by God, ſuperſtitiouſly thinking them vnlawfull; to go on pilgrimage to the images or reliks of this or that ſuppoſed Saint, and the like. So alſo to make vowes of perpetuall virginitie, and to thinke our ſelues in conſcience obliged to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keeping of ſuch vows, though in the meane time ſuch votaries either burne in luſts, or haue their whores, and thinke it better ſo to haue, then to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; directly contrary to the Apoſtles commandement, that <hi>for the auoiding of fornication, euery man ſhould haue his own</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor 7. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>wife:</hi> as alſo contrary to that elſewhere ſaid of <hi>mariage,</hi> to<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> be <hi>honorable amongſt all men,</hi> without exception of any, fit for mariage, and needing mariage. The like is to be ſaid of the vow of wilfull pouertie, and mens betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to Monaſteries, by the witchcraft and enchantment of Poperie, for the enriching of their ſuperſtitious and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous houſes, falſly called Houſes of Religion.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of conformitie to the Popes buls for diſcharge of ſubiects from their allegiance to Princes, God hauing commanded euery ſoule of the Clergie, as they ſpeake, yea of the Pope himſelfe (if he haue a ſoule) to <hi>be ſubiect to the higher powers,</hi> as well as the ſoules of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13.</note> yea, the holy Ghoſt hauing commanded <hi>prayers, ſupplications, interceſſions and thanksgiuing to be made</hi> as for<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 1. 2.</note> all other ſorts of men, ſo eſpecially <hi>for Kings and all in authoritie,</hi> yea euen then when there were no Chriſtian
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:210:96"/> Kings, but all were heathen and infidels. To thinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or to practiſe otherwiſe vpon the Popes diſcharge, is to be conformable to the world, and not vnto God and to his word.</p>
               <p>So is it alſo to marry within the degrees of kindred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Lord; and to do any thing elſe contrary to any commandement of God, onely vpon the Popes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. The like is to be ſaid of doing any thing elſe forbidden by God, either by the perſwaſions, or by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the world, or any men of the world, either in<note place="margin">Act. 4. 19. &amp;. 3 29. Deut. 13. 6. Exod. 23. 2. Mat. 7. 13.</note> reſpect of authoritie, or in reſpect of kindred and affinitie and friendſhip, or in reſpect of multitude.</p>
               <p>The vſe of all this, is to admoniſh vs to take heed of all common ſinnes of the time, ſwearing, blaſpheming, drinking and drunkenneſſe, whoring, and all other carnall wantonneſſe; proſaning of the Lords dayes by buying, ſelling, riding, &amp;c. gaming, rioting, contempt of the word and Sacraments, as likewiſe of magiſtrates or miniſters, or parents or maſters, &amp;c. For the commonneſſe of theſe things doth not any whit excuſe or leſſen them, or giue vs the more libertie to commit them; but it doth the more aggrauate them: and the more do conforme vnto other in them, the more ought all that deſire to ſacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to God, to beware of all conformitie with them.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially, according to ſome thing before ſaid, let vs beware of worſhipping our onely true God in the falſe and adulterous maner that the Papiſts the greateſt part of the world in Europe do worſhip him, or as they worſhip their idols. For certainly the gods of thoſe nations that the Lord did caſt out before the Iſraelites, of the manner of whoſe worſhip the Lord charged them to beware in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of him: the gods (I ſay) of thoſe nations were ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer more abominable in Gods eyes, then the idols of the Papiſts are; yea, not ſo abominable: For neuer was there ſo much ſpoken of any amongſt thoſe heathen, as is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the new Babylon, Rome: there neuer was any called an Anti-god, as now the Pope is called Anti-chriſt:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:210:96"/> There neuer was any ſtyled with the name of <hi>The man of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>child of perdition,</hi> as the Pope now is. There was neuer any ſaid ſo to <hi>oppoſe &amp; exalt himſelfe aboue all that is called God,</hi> or that <hi>is worſhipped,</hi> as the Pope is ſaid to do. There was neuer any that chalenged to himſelfe all power in heauen and in earth, to forgiue ſinnes, &amp;c. as the Pope doth. There was neuer any that claimed power to ſet vp and to depoſe Kings at his pleaſure, as the Pope doth. The head therefore of the Papiſts being ſo wicked, and ſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe to be of the world, can the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that are his deuoted ſlaues and bondmen, be better? How then may we haue any conformitie with them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the worſhip of God? Oh let vs not forget how great the ſinne of <hi>Ahaz</hi> was, in ſending a patterne of an Altar from Damaſcus, and commanding <hi>Vriah</hi> the Prieſt<note place="margin">2. Kin. 16. 20.</note> to make another at Ieruſalem conformable thereunto. It is therefore no ſmall matter to dally with God, or to faile in the leaſt point of the maner onely of his worſhip. For though our ſelues may be deceiued, not onely by other, but alſo by our owne hearts, <hi>being deceitfull out of meaſure:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 9. Gal. 6. 7.</note> and though we may alſo deceiue other, yet God neuer is deceiued or mocked. It is not good (they ſay) to play with<note place="margin">Iſay. 6. 3. Reu. 4. 8. 1. Sam. 2. 2.</note> Saints; much leſſe with him that is <hi>holy, holy, holy,</hi> and with whom in holineſſe none is to be compared.</p>
               <p>We may yet extend this conformitie to the world a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further, and more particularly to the Miniſters of the word, viz. for their not conforming themſelues in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, either to the old Popiſh Schoole-men and Friers, or to the Ieſuites and Popiſh Prieſts of theſe times, euen in their ſuch maner of preaching, by affecting much Latin, and many friuolous diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, needleſſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, abſtruſe and quaint points, whereby the Scripture is not plainly and perſpicuouſly opened, neither fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but rather obſcured, without any edifying of the hearers: yea, whereby alſo ſome points of Poperie are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly couched, to make way for other afterward. This I do the rather adde, becauſe the practiſe of ſome in this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:210:97"/> kind of preaching amongſt vs, is much to be lamented: yea, the more, becauſe it is applauded by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding almoſt nothing that they heare. Alas, did the ancient Leuites in the time of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſo preach, of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>they read in the booke of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 8. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>law of God diſtinctly, and gaue the ſenſe, and cauſed the people to vnderſtand the reading?</hi> Is this according to <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> for <hi>rightly diuiding the word of truth?</hi> Is ſuch<note place="margin">2.

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 18. 2. Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>abundance,</hi> yet for all that made no oſtentation of any ſuch learning, neither declared <hi>the teſtimonie of God with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>excellencie of ſpeech, or in the words which mans wiſedome did teach, but which the holy Ghoſt taught, comparing ſpirituall things with ſpirituall?</hi> Yea, who alſo ſaid, that not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his varietie of tongues, <hi>he had rather ſpeake</hi> (but) <hi>fiue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>words with his vnderſtanding, that he might teach other alſo, then ten thouſand words in an vnknowne tongue?</hi> Yea, is this kind of preaching (whereof now I ſpeake) according to the preaching of the moſt learned and reuerend Preachers and Fathers in our Church, who do not onely labour themſelues to preach plainly and to the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their hearers, but alſo earneſtly exhort all other to preach in like maner? Oh therefore that all other Miniſters would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues in their preaching to theſe examples, and leaue all conformitie herein with the olde ruſtie Schoole-men, Friers, and other Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed any further, I might here obſerue the paſſiue voice, eſpecially for ſpirituall conformitie, that is, for conformitie in apparent and knowne ſinnes. For the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>and conforme not your ſelues,</hi> but he ſaith, <hi>and be not conformed,</hi> by any other, either by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or by their counſels, allurements and inticements whatſoeuer. This I might the rather obſerue, becauſe ſome excuſe their conformitie to the world, euen in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by the prouocation of other to the ſaid conformitie. But endeuouring breuitie, I will content my ſelfe with the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:210:97"/> bare naming of this obſeruation.</p>
               <p>To come now to bodily conformitie, thereby I meane<note place="margin">Bodily confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> not ſuch conformitie as is altogether and onely bodily, nothing ſpirituall; but that which is eſpecially of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and in ſuch things as pertaine to the bodie: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are by the moſt accounted bodily, and not at all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; and therefore to be no ſinne at all in ſuch things to conforme to the world. But ſuch dreamers, and they that do ſo thinke, haue forgotten the like plea of ſome for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters in the Apoſtles time, and his anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>All things are lawfull to me, but all things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient:</hi>

                  <hi>drinkes,</hi> viz. onely or principally, yet euen in ſuch things we are to haue reſpect to the kingdome of God. But what are theſe things now to be touched concerning bodily conformitie? Euen the generall conformitie of all ſorts, of all ages, of men and women, as well profeſſors of the word as of other, to the world, and to them that are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the world, meere worldlings, and a very little better then Atheiſts. Wherein is this conformitie? Firſt of all in apparell, not ſo much touching the matter, the ſame being oftentimes aboue mens callings and abilities, that therein they may braue it out with the beſt; but alſo and eſpecially in the faſhion and colour, and maner of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king the ſame. For the Lord hath commanded not ſome<note place="margin">Theſ. 5. 5. 8. Eheſ. 5. 8.</note> but all that are <hi>of the day</hi> (that is, <hi>children of the light) to be ſober,</hi> with ſobrietie ioyning <hi>the breaſtplate of faith, and loue, and hope of ſaluation:</hi> thereby ſhewing that where
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:210:98"/> there is true faith, and loue, and hope, there is and will be ſobrietie alſo; and the leſſe ſobrietie, bewrayeth leſſe faith, loue and hope. So ſaith <hi>Peter, Girding vp the loynes of your mind, be ſober, and hope to the end, &amp;c.</hi> No ſobrietie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 13.</note> no hope to the end. And againe, <hi>Be ſober and watch, for the diuell your aduerſarie goeth about like a roaring Lion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeking whom to deuoure.</hi> They therefore that are not ſober, expoſe and lay open themſelues to the diuell. I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge many other Scriptures in commendation of ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Yea but, will ſome man ſay, ſuch Scriptures are onely for ſobrietie of the mind, and confining of the thoughts, and moderation of the affections, the which are (as it were) the loines of our minds. What then? The inward man commandeth the outward. Where there is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſobrietie, there cannot but be the outward. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward may be where there is not the inward: but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the inward to be without the outward, where there is knowledge of the things that belong to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſobrietie.</p>
               <p>The ſharp reprehenſion alſo of the daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſay. 3. 16. &amp;c.</note> for their immodeſtie in apparell, and lightneſſe in their geſture, <hi>going minſingly, and with their neckes ſtretched out,</hi> (oh that our Ladies and other fine Dames would wiſely conſider that place, &amp; make vſe thereof accordingly,) this reprehenſion (I ſay of thoſe daughters of <hi>Zion</hi>) doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the like in all, and commend the contrary to all. The Lord alſo by another Prophet doth very heauily threaten to puniſh <hi>the Princes, and the Kings children, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>all ſuch</hi> (without exception of any) <hi>as are clothed with ſtrange apparell.</hi> What ſhall I ſay of the Apoſtolicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for <hi>women to adorne themſelues with ſhamefaſtneſſe and ſobrietie, &amp;c?</hi> Do not theſe Scriptures belong to theſe times, as well as other Scriptures both commandements and promiſes? Denie the one, and denie the other; take away the one, and take away the other. So in the end, we that haue receiued moſt mercies, ſhall be moſt lawleſſe. No Scriptures ſhall belong vnto vs. May any looke for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:210:98"/> without the Scriptures, which onely <hi>are able to make</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>vs wiſe vnto ſaluation?</hi> Do not ſuch Scriptures alſo belong to men as well as women? Doubtleſſe they do; except men will ſay, that God will haue women onely to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and not men. Women are eſpecially named, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſexe moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly is giuen moſt to pride &amp; new faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yet that place of <hi>Zephaniah</hi> is of men, Princes, and Kings ſonnes, yea of all ſuch generally as are clothed <hi>with ſtrange apparell,</hi> or with the apparell of ſtrangers. If yet any will harp vpon the former ſtring, of thoſe Scriptures of the old Teſtament to be now out of date, as hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed onely to the Iſraelites; let him remember, that <hi>whatſoeuer things are aforetime written, are written</hi> as well<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>for our learning</hi> (or inſtruction) as for the learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Iſraelites: yea rather more for vs, then for<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 12.</note> them. And hath the Lord dealt more bountifully with vs then with them, and doth he not require more dutie of vs then of them? Doubleſſe the more that God hath hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Heb. 2, 1.</note> vs, by ſpeaking immediatly vnto vs by his Sonne in our owne nature, the more earneſt heed we ought to giue to thoſe things which we haue heard from that his Son, &amp;c. Yet alas in theſe times, and in this matter of faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the world, all men liue as if there were no word of God to the contrary: yea, as though not onely the Pope (that diſpenſeth with greater matters) but God himſelfe had giuen diſpenſation for all to liue as they liſt, and to do what they liſt. We may now well crie out, O the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the faſhions of theſe times. He that in apparell will ſee the faſhions of all countries, need not to trauell out of our owne land: he may ſee all, and more then all within the land. Euery other nation do better content themſelues with their owne faſhions, then we here in England. Yea, we here in England, by our multiplicitie of faſhions, do reade a lecture of doing the like to all other nations.</p>
               <p>This horſe diſeaſe of the faſhions, hath hatched another of the yellowes, as dangerous, as foule, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely as the former, a ſpecies and a daughter of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:210:99"/> and from the foundations of the world (for ought appeareth by any hiſtories) neuer heard of till now very lately, and in our land, as if the ſame were the common ſchoole of all vanitie; except onely in Ireland, where they ſaffron all their wearing linnen (as ſome report) for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of that vermin, that do moſt abound in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> country.</p>
               <p>Thrift indeed is pleaded for this yellowing of linnen, as the which being ſo yellowed, needeth not ſo much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing. But why do they not ſo yellow alſo their other wearing linnen, and bed-linnen and table-linnen? They alſo that herein do moſt pleade thrift, in all other things are leaſt thriftie; yea, moſt prodigall, moſt riotous.</p>
               <p>With the premiſes may be remembred the diuers formes otherwiſe of apparell, ſometime long waiſts, ſometimes ſhort waiſts; the aprons of women and the girdles of men being almoſt at their chins. So alſo the varietie of mens breeches, ſometimes like great cloak-bags, ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like water-tankers at the top. So alſo of hats, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times high crowned, ſometimes low crowned; ſometimes narrow brimmed, ſometimes broad brimmed, ſo bangling about the eares of men, and hiding their faces, that they cannot eaſily be diſcerned: and therefore the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling ſuch couerings of the face as the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 4. 4. &amp;c.</note> the men of Corinth in their Eccleſiaſticall meetings and religious exerciſes. Notwithſtanding ſuch hats ſeeme more tollerable for women, as being more agreeable to ſuch couerings as the Apoſtle commendeth to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Corinth, in the place before alledged.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the varietie of girdles, points, garters, bootes, ſpurres, ſhooes, and ſhoo-ſtrings; though now bootes and ſpurres haue go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the vpper hand of ſhoos and ſhoo-ſtrings, and haue almoſt iuſtled them like Iacke of Lent cleane out of doores.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the former diſeaſes of faſhions generally, and of the yellowes particularly, go not alone, but are likewiſe accompanied with a third, at leaſt in men, namely, the ſtaggers. For alas, how do men in theſe dayes, of all ſorts
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:210:99"/> almoſt, ſtagger and reele in all places. Husbandmen, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants men and boyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come not to any market almoſt, but they go home ſtaggering and reeling. But this belonging to the ſpirituall conformity to the world before ſpoken of, it ſhall be ſufficient to haue interpoſed thus much thereof in this place: the rather haue I named this now, (though ſomewhat diſorderly) becauſe I had before but named the roote of this diſeaſe. The premiſes are the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reproofe, becauſe as <hi>the ſpider taketh hold with her</hi>

Kings 1. 6.</note> acceſſorie vnto them. O lamentable, O wofull. For, is this inhibition of conformitie to the world, only to husbands themſelues, and not alſo to wiues? to parents, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to children? to maſters, &amp; not alſo to ſeruants? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is to the one as well as to the other. The husband<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 24. Mat. 195. Pſal. 128. 3.</note> and wife are one fleſh. Children are branches of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Seruants are hands to their maſters. All make an houſhold. Is not <hi>Abraham</hi> commended that he would<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>teach his children and houſhold the way of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> The commendation of <hi>Abraham</hi> is a commandement for all that will be children to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and a reprehenſion of all that do not that, for which <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended. Oh let ſuch remember the ſharp reprehenſion of <hi>Eli</hi> by<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 31. &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and. 3. 17.</note> the Lord, for his being no ſharper to his children: as alſo the fearfull commination againſt his houſe in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that behalfe,<note place="margin">1. Kings. 2. 17.</note> with the euent according.</p>
               <p>Here let vs not omit amongſt the conformities of theſe times to the world womens painting their faces and breaſts, and laying open their ſaid breaſts moſt immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, almoſt to their waſts, yea, their picturing likewiſe vpon their breaſts cherries and birds, yea, the patching of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:210:100"/> them alſo, and of their faces, here a patch and there a patch. Oh abominable, oh monſtrous; the daughters of Zion before mentioned and wicked <hi>Ieſabel</hi> her ſelfe neuer came to this height.</p>
               <p>To the former may be added their wearing of ſtrange haire, I meane the haire of other women, either bought of ſome that are poore, and for money glad to cut it off to ſerue the fooliſh deſires of other, or taken from the heads of ſome before dead, the which ſtrange haire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> likewiſe ſometimes they dye, not according to the colour of their owne haire, but white, or of ſome other colour, according to the faſhion of moſt, that ſo all in colour of haire may be like one to another, how vnlike ſoeuer in complexion; and all may weare one liuerie, as ſeruing all one miſtris. The like may be ſaid of their pendent locke about their cheekes moſt vndecently, howſoeuer they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues adorned thereby, and directly contrary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Paul</hi> and of <hi>Peter,</hi> I ſuppoſe alſo that if they knew<note place="margin">1.

               <p>But let vs diue a little deeper into theſe deepe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of theſe times, drawne from the deepe pit of hell it ſelfe. How therefore haue men and women changed their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of ſuch ſhort haired Gentlewomen, I find not one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, either in Scripture, or elſewhere. And what ſhall I ſay of ſuch poled rigs, ramps and Tomboyes? May it not be thought that they do ſo, that ſometimes by ſome not knowing them, they may be taken for yong men in long coates, the rather becauſe ſome of them alſo weare boots and ſpurres, and ſhort ſwords by their ſides, that being ſo taken they may alſo be bed-fellowes to ſuch yong men, and ſo play the harlots with them, as holy Pope <hi>Ioane</hi> did, who by that meanes being with child, fell into her trauell thereof as ſhe was in the midſt of her holy Proceſſion with al her carnall Cardinals, none of them all perceiuing any ſuch thing before.</p>
               <p>We may aske the queſtion that the Lord asketh, and make that anſwer that the Lord alſo maketh: <hi>Were they</hi>

In the meane time, the leſſe themſelues are aſhamed or touched with this their great ſinne, let vs all that feare God, mourne the more for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:210:101"/> them, praying alſo for them (as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> intreated <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to pray for him) that none of thoſe things<note place="margin">Act. 8. 24.</note> they haue deſerued may come vpon them. Yea, let vs mourne and pray the more for our ſelues and the whole Land, becauſe ſuch ſinnes are crying ſinnes in the eares of the Lord of hoaſts, for iudgement againſt the whole Land.</p>
               <p>With that before ſaid, of mens wearing long haire like to women, we may ioyne the great varietie of mens cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their haire, whereby they greatly diſguiſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues, not onely making themſelues fooles, but looking alſo like to ſome vnreaſonable creatures: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſome fooles of the country that go to plough and cart, and in other places men of all trades, tailers, ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers butchers, millers, tapſters, &amp;c. are to be admired for their ſtrange locks and long haire, ſome all before, ſome all behind, ſome long round about, their crownes being cut ſhort like cootes or Popiſh Prieſts and Priers: ſome hauing long locks at their eares, as if they had foure eares, or were prick-eared: ſome hauing a little long locke onely before, hanging downe to their noſes, like to the taile of a weaſell; euery man being made a foole at the Barbers pleaſure, or making a foole of the Barber, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to make him ſuch a foole. For as it is ſaid of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of idols and images, <hi>They that make them, are like vnto them:</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of ſuch fooles and ſuch barbers.<note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt lamentable eſpecially is it, that great fore-tops and long haire hath ſeized vpon ſome in the miniſterie, that come vp to the chaire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> more like ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens butlers, then Miniſters of the word; and being in that place, they conforme themſelues to another ſort alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the world, namely, Players, and ſo they ſpeake like to actors vpon a ſtage. Alas, how lamentable is this? I do the rather ſpeake a word hereof, hoping that my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may come to the hands of ſome that haue power and hearts to reforme it. For it is a great ſcandall, and no ſmall diſgrace to that honorable calling. The yong yeares of ſome, may not be pleaded for excuſe thereof: becauſe

               <p>I might ſpeake much more of this theame, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reckon all faſhions of the world, and of other vnto them; and therefore no longer to linger in this conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the world, which maketh a deformitie of all things; neither to ſpeake any more of Gods childrens faſhioning themſelues to this wicked world, that putteth all out of faſhion; before notwithſtanding I paſſe altogether from<note place="margin">The pronowne, this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The riches of the world are vncertaine, their honours vncertaine, their friendſhip vncertaine, their health vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, their liues vncertaine, not onely as other mens, but alſo much more: who therefore that is wiſe would conforme vnto them?</p>
               <p>Beſides the former vncertaintie in euery reſpect of the men of the world, who ſeeth not that men faſhioning themſelues to the world, and being at greater expenſes by the daily change of ſuch faſhions, then they need, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able themſelues from performing many duties of loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other, and from leauing ſo much to their own children (though many) as their parents left to themſelues alone? yea, ſometimes by ſuch conformitie and often change of faſhions, as new faſhions are inuented, <hi>they that were</hi> (at the firſt) <hi>full,</hi> are brought to ſuch penurie, that they are glad to <hi>hire themſelues out for bread:</hi> or that which is worſe,<note place="margin">1.

The like oppoſition of impoſſible agreement together, is noted by the ſame word in the originall text elſewhere, as when our Sauiour ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 17. Ioh. 6. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Fleſh and blood hath not reuealed this vnto thee, but my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen.</hi> And, <hi>Labour not for the meate which periſheth, but for the meate which abideth to euerlaſting life.</hi> By the ſame word alſo <hi>Paul</hi> noteth ſuch an oppoſition

                  <hi>looking on the things that are ſeene,</hi> and <hi>the things that are not ſeene,</hi> is expreſt by the ſame word that is here tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>but.</hi> So when <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith to <hi>Gaius, Follow not that which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Ioh. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>is euill, but that which is good;</hi> he teacheth, that both euill and good cannot be followed. Many other the like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there are, needleſſe to be here alledged. By this word therefore <hi>but,</hi> the Apoſtle in this place teacheth, vs, that<note place="margin">2. Kin. 17. 33. 41</note> we can be no more conformed to the world and thus transformed, then we can truly <hi>feare God, and yet ſerue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods;</hi> or then we may <hi>ſweare by the Lord and by Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this word <hi>but,</hi> in ſinuateth ſomething to be vnderſtood after the word <hi>be transformed,</hi> whereunto we muſt be transformed, as well as before the Apoſtle had ſhewed whereunto we muſt not be conformed, viz. to the world. As therefore conforming and transforming are oppoſed one to another; ſo, what is to be oppoſed to the world, but God himſelfe? For we haue before heard, that <hi>the amitie of the world,</hi> and <hi>the wiſedome of the world,</hi> are oppoſed to <hi>the loue of God,</hi> and to <hi>the wiſedome of God.</hi> By theſe things therefore it is euident, that when the Apoſtle exhorteth vs to be <hi>transformed,</hi> he meaneth, we ſhould be transformed to God, in being holy as he is holy, as before we heard. It is a turning, but from the world vnto God, as God himſelfe ſaith, <hi>If thou returne, returne vnto me.</hi> And<note place="margin">Iam 4. 1. A &amp;. 16. 18. Epheſ. 22. 2. Cor. 4. 4.</note> this all one with <hi>turning from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan (the Prince</hi> and <hi>god of this world) vnto God.</hi> This turning muſt be of our whole man, as the former ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of our ſelues. It muſt be in truth, and not in ſhew, as the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Satan transformeth himſelfe into</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 13. 14</note> 
                  <hi>an Angell of light.</hi> For the word there vſed, is not that that is here in the ſecond place, but that that is before vſed, and tranſlated <hi>be not conformed to this world,</hi> whereby the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:210:104"/> diſtinction before noted out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the two originall words here tranſlated <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> and <hi>transformed,</hi> ſeemeth to be the more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, becauſe as <hi>Satans transforming himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light,</hi> is not reall and permanent, but ſuperficiall, and therefore ſuddenly vaniſheth, he quickly appearing in his colours againe: ſo all conformitie to the world is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, and doth quickly vaniſh, like a morning miſt or dew, or rain-bow in a cloud. But transformitie and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God, is that that continueth and abideth for euer. Once wrought, it is done for euer. For as it is vnto God, ſo it is of God, who is not like to that vnwiſe man that <hi>taketh in hand the building of a tower, neuer counting before</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>what it will coſt him,</hi> and is therefore forced to leaue before he haue finiſhed it, as not being able to go through with it; but God is wiſe, and able to go through ſtitch with whatſoeuer he beginneth: for who can hinder him? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding becauſe no man is here ſo transformed and turned to God, but that ſtil there remaineth in them ſome corruptions, and ſome dregs, and as it were ſtumps of the old man, in reſpect whereof he may ſtill crie out as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe did, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>from this bodie of death?</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle here exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth theſe worthy Romanes to transforme themſelues, that is, more and more to turne vnto God, as before he had exhorted them to preſent themſelues <hi>a ſacrifice to God, liuing, &amp;c.</hi> though they had bin ſuch a ſacrifice long before. Now both our firſt, and our ſecond, and our daily turning vnto God, is the worke onely of God, according<note place="margin">Pſal. 80. 7. 19.</note> to the Prophets prayer, <hi>Turne vs againe, O Lord God of hoaſts, &amp;c.</hi> and that becauſe our ſaid firſt turning is as great a worke as the firſt creation of the world; and our ſecond and daily turning, is as great a worke as Gods daily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the world: yet for all that, we haue all need of daily exhortations ſo to turne, as the meanes whereby God worketh our ſaid turning, and prouoketh vs more and more ſo to turne.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:210:105"/>
               <p>The word here vſed, is alſo of the paſſiue voice, to teach vs as much as before I ſaid, that it is not our worke ſo to turne and to transforme our ſelues, but the Lords.</p>
               <p>It is alſo that word that is vſed for Chriſts transfiguration<note place="margin">Mat 17. 2. Mark. 9. 2.</note> in the Mount: yet it doth not croſſe any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue ſaid. For though that transfiguration or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation were but for a time, for the better ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting of thoſe Diſciples that he had there with him: yet it was in truth, and reall, as a preſident of that glorie he ſhould haue when he ſhould aſcend into<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3. 8. 1.</note> heauen, and the which now he hath in the heauens, <hi>at the right hand of Maieſtie.</hi> It was not like to that transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that before we ſpake of, of <hi>Satan into an Angell of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 13:</note> 
                  <hi>light;</hi> but it was that very true transformation which he had in his aſcenſion, and yet hath, and euer ſhall haue. Yea, this very word alſo is vſed of vs by the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>We all as with an open face beholding as in a glaſſe the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>glorie of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glorie to glorie, &amp;c.</hi> For here alſo he meaneth a reall and a true change, not a change only in ſhew. The ſumme of this is, that it is not enough for vs not to be conformed vnto the world, but we muſt be transformed and made like vnto God. This ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken of theſe words, <hi>But be transformed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next word in our text, is concerning the inward<note place="margin">By the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your mind.</note> meanes of our transforming vnto God; this is ſaid to be <hi>by the renewing of our minds.</hi> Or theſe words may be read thus, <hi>in the renewing of the mind:</hi> as noting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubiect wherin this transformation is begun: but I rather reade it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the meanes of our transforming. So here are two things: <hi>renewing;</hi> and the ſubiect of renewing, viz. <hi>the mind.</hi> Neither is the pronoune <hi>your,</hi> altogether to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but to be obſerued, as teaching, that although theſe Romanes were already excellent Chriſtians, (it were well if our Romaniſts were ſuch) yet euen they need more renewing, and daily renewing of their mindes; as alſo that men muſt not poſt ouer the inſtruction of men to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:210:105"/> but apply them to themſelues. But the chiefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here, is the renewing of the minde. Now although theſe two words intimate two things (as I ſaid,) firſt a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing;</hi> ſecondly, of the <hi>mind:</hi> yet I will not ſpeake ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally, but ioyntly of them both. The former expreſſeth a renewing; the other ſignifieth how and in what maner, or rather in what part we muſt be renewed. If we wil not be conformed to the world, but deſire to be transformed and turned vnto God, we muſt be firſt renewed. Without renewing, all our not conforming to the world, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and faſhioning our ſelues vnto God, is nothing worth. But this renewing muſt be of our mind. If our minds be not renewed, all other things are nothing; euen all the renewing of our outward man: yea, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either for our outward man to be renewed, or being renewed, long to hold and continue, except the minde be renewed. If the mind be renewed, the whole man will be renewed. The Apoſtle hath the like words, though not the ſame, elſewhere, <hi>Be ye renewed in the ſpirit of your mind.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 23.</note> The word renewing coming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a verb compounded with a prepoſition prefixed, in compoſition ſignifying a reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a thing before done; here ſignifieth the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the mind to that ſtate wherein it was before the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>mind,</hi> is to be vnderſtood the principalleſt part or power of our ſoule, the chiefe ſeate of our reaſon, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and thoughts; the queene and commander of all our affections, and of the will it ſelfe. This being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the whole heart or ſoule will be changed. This being renewed and reſtored to the firſt perfection thereof in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in his firſt creation, the whole heart and ſoule will be renewed and reſtored, which is done by the word. The<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7.</note> whole heart being renewed and reſtored, touching know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, thoughts and affections, and will alſo it ſelfe, the whole outward man, touching all the behauiour thereof, will alſo be renewed and reſtored. Yet all this renewing<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 9. 4. &amp;c.</note> is but <hi>in part</hi> in this life, but to be made perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:210:106"/> in the life to come. Notwithſtanding being here once begun, this beginning is ſuch an aſſurance of that future perfection thereof, as that all the diuels in hell by all their ſubtiltie and power ſhall neuer be able to hinder the ſaid perfection.</p>
               <p>This mention here of the renewing of our mind, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, the very mind and beſt part of men to be decayed; for otherwiſe there needed no renewing.</p>
               <p>It teacheth alſo, that there remaineth ſome oldneſſe in the mindes of them that are as well renewed as theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes; in reſpect whereof they haue need to be euery day more and more renewed.</p>

               <p>But how ſhall we be ſo withdrawne from conformitie to the world, and be transformed vnto God, and renewed in our minds? It is the worke onely of God; yet he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it by meanes, eſpecially by preaching his word, wherein this will of God is contained: yea, he beginneth it, vpholdeth it, and increaſeth it by this meanes; as alſo by much reading and meditation of the ſaid word; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference likewiſe with them that haue more ſhaken off the world, and turned vnto God, and be more renewed in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:210:108"/> their mindes then our ſelues. And all theſe will be the more bleſſed vnto vs, the more often and earneſtly by prayer we craue the bleſſing of God vpon them. I could plentifully proue theſe particulars, but that I labour for breuitie.</p>
               <p>The next point to be conſidered, is the thing it ſelfe<note place="margin">The will of God, and what is meant hereby</note> to be proued, <hi>This is the will,</hi> not of man, but <hi>of God.</hi> What is this will of God? If I ſhould tread in the ſteps of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> vpon all the former words of this text, who maketh point vpon point, as the reſt of the Schoole-men likewiſe do vpon other Scriptures, I would I might not ſay alſo as ſome in theſe dayes vpon euery text do ſo make <hi>quaere</hi> vpon <hi>quaere,</hi> that they rather obſcure then illuſtrate and open the Scripture, and ſo do more oppreſſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of their hearers or readers, then edifie them, and ſtand long vpon a little, and be tedious to all men; if (I ſay) I ſhould take this courſe in ſhewing what <hi>will of God</hi> is here meant, I might make diſtinction vpon diſtinction, (as the Schoole-men do vpon the grace of God, and of what not) and ſo alſo make more ſhew of learning then I haue, and yet with no great profit to other. To omit therefore this veine, which to me ſeemeth but vaine; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the former queſtion of the will of God, <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> ſaith, that ſome vnderſtand it of thoſe things that God wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Other vnderſtand it of all before ſpoken, of not conforming our ſelues to the world, of being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto God, and renewed in our mind; as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaid of all that, <hi>This is the will of God.</hi> Of theſe two opinions, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> approueth the former, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to allow it ſpoken of Gods will reuealed in his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:210:108"/> written word, but of the will of God reuealed by his works, in ſending proſperitie or aduerſitie, peace or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, health or ſickneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haymo</hi> (though a fooliſh Papiſt) interpreteth it of the reuealed wil of God in the Scriptures. For thus he writeth firſt of all, of not conforming vnto the world, &amp; of being renewed in our mind: <hi>Nolite (inquit) conformari huic ſeculo, i. nolite ſimiles fieri amatoris huius ſeculi, &amp;c.</hi> Be not (ſaith he) conformed to this world, that is, be not like vnto the louers of this world, who deſpiſe vertues and follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vices: <hi>ſed reformamini in nouitate ſenſus veſtri, per ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam lectionis &amp; meditationis veteris &amp; noui Teſtamenti:</hi> but be reformed in the newneſſe of your mind, by the ſtudie of the reading and meditation of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our ſenſe and vnderſtanding is daily renewed and reformed, whiles we profit daily, and more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in wiſedome, vnderſtanding thoſe things of God, which before we were ignorant of, &amp;c. Afterward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the word now in hand, <hi>that ye may proue what is the will of God,</hi> thus he writeth, <hi>Qui ſacras Scripturas ſedulò legit, ille inuenit quid ſit voluntas Dei. &amp;c.</hi> He that diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly readeth the holy scriptures, findeth what is the will of God, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what pleaſeth God, what diſpleaſeth him, or how his will may be fulfilled. For in all our actions we ought to weigh whether our works be acceptable to God or no. Thus much out of <hi>Haymo:</hi> and the more, that we may the more admire the wiſedome of God in bringing ſuch ſweete water out of ſuch a bitter and ſtinking foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as anon we ſhall ſee. The ſame alſo ſeemeth to be the iudgement of <hi>Piſcator</hi> in his <hi>Scholia</hi> vpon theſe words. So of <hi>Rolloc.</hi> For vpon theſe words, <hi>that ye may proue,</hi> thus he ſaith, <hi>Hic finis eſt transformationis ſine renouationis men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vt viuamus ex voluntate Dei, &amp;c.</hi> This is the end of our transformation or renewing of our mind, that we may liue according to the will of God: for this is that which he ſaith, that we may proue what is the will of God. For we proue (or approue) the will of God, whiles we liue
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:210:109"/> according vnto it. Now we are not to liue according to the ſecret wil of God, manifeſted only by his prouidence, but according to his will onely reuealed in his ſacred Scriptures. This is alſo the iudgement of moſt reuerend <hi>Caluin.</hi> For after other things ſoundly written vpon this text, he addeth, <hi>Mundus quo ipſo fabricauit opera, ſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadet eſſe bona, &amp;c.</hi> The world perſwadeth it ſelfe that the works which it forgeth are good; <hi>Paul</hi> denieth, ſaying, that by Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The world to find perfection, falleth to new inuentions; <hi>Paul</hi> determining all perfection to be in the will of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that if any man paſſeth theſe limits, he is deluded by a falſe imagination. All this ſaith <hi>Caluin,</hi> wherein who can diſſent from him?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, to ſpeake my mind ingenuouſly and freely, without the enuie of any, I do not think the whole reuealed will of God in his word to be here meant, but chiefly and principally the wil of God reuealed in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, firſt preached by our Sauiour, and afterwards by his Apoſtles and other Miniſters thereof according to the preaching of Chriſt, and to the preaching and writing of the Apoſtles, yet alſo contained (though not ſo perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly)<note place="margin">A &amp;. 26. 22. Rom. 12.</note> in the writings of the Prophets and <hi>Moſes.</hi> And I do the rather thus thinke, becauſe this will of God in the Goſpell is moſt worthy to be called by the name of the will of God, as the which reuoketh and cancelleth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in the old Teſtament, and is the laſt will of<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> God, in theſe laſt times deliuered by the Sonne of God. For as the laſt Will of a man is his onely Will, diſanulling all former Wils, and all former gifts and bequeſts not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the laſt Will: ſo this laſt will of God, in many things diſanulling the former, and in many things alſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the ſame, is chiefly, principally, and onely to be accounted the wil of God. The three adiuncts alſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:210:109"/> whereby this will of God is deſcribed and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, do moſt fitly belong to this laſt wil, reuealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Goſpel, and in the ſcriptures of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as afterward ſhall more fully appeare. As for the morall Law, that is not at all nullified by the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but thereby ratified, as appeareth Matth. 5. from the ſeuenteenth verſe to the end, and by many precepts of the Apoſtles for obſeruation both of the whole moral<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> Law, and alſo of all the particular duties therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>Touching the vſe hereof, let vs alwayes for auoiding of conformitie to the world, and for transforming our ſelues vnto God, and the renewing of our minds, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this wil of God reuealed in his word, eſpecially<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 25. 2.

For he bringeth a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite interpretation, as it were a Tridentine forke (more vſuall indeed to loade dung with, then to make hay with) expounding theſe three adiuncts three wayes, and yet not ſaying to any, <hi>vtrum harum mauis accipe,</hi> of theſe three chuſe which pleaſeth you beſt; but leauing them all at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as if they were all meant by the Apoſtle.<note place="margin">The tripertite interpretation of three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts of Gods will by <hi>Haymo.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>But what are theſe three interpretations of his? The firſt is this: <hi>Bona voluntas Dei eſt quia bona deſiderat ſemper, &amp;c.</hi> The wil of God is good, becauſe he alwayes deſireth thoſe things that are good: it is well pleaſing, becauſe all good things are pleaſing vnto him: it is perfect, becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no doubling, but thoſe things that are done with a ſincere heart. Where let it be noted, that he condemneth ſuch iuggling and equiuocating as now is commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:210:110"/> and ſtoutly defended by the Papiſts. That is his firſt interpretation, not much to be blamed. What is his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond? <hi>Aliter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bona in fide; bene placens in ſpe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turorum bonorum; perfecta in Dei charitate, id eſt, in Dei di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectione &amp; proximi: haec enim tua voluntatem Dei perficiunt:</hi> Good in faith; well pleaſing in the hope of good things to come; perfect in charitie, that is, in the loue of God and our neighbour: for theſe three make perfect the will of God. What is the third interpretation? Moſt excellent. <hi>Siue aliter, Bona voluntas Dei eſt in coniugalis, bene placens in viduis, perfecta in virginibus. hi tres ordines, ſi ſecundùm voluntatem Dei, &amp; virtutis tramitem proceſſerint, proemijs voluntatis Dei donabuntur:</hi> Or otherwiſe (ſaith he) the wil of God is good in maried perſons; well pleaſing in wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and widowers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perfect in virgins, that is, in perſons neuer maried: theſe three orders, if they proceed according to the will of God, and in the pathway of vertues, ſhall be rewarded with the rewards of the will of God. Is not this luſtily done? Hath he not plaid the man in them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the laſt? Alas, what pitie was it that he died but a Biſhop, and was not firſt rewarded with the triple crown of Rome. The firſt indeed (as I ſaid) of theſe, is not much to be blamed, ſaue that the one may be confounded with the other. The ſecond is the leſſe to be condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 13.</note> he aimeth at the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Now abideth faith hope and charitie.</hi> Yet when he ſaith, that theſe three make perfect the will of God, and yet before had put per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in charitie, he ſeemeth to confound and contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dict himſelfe, making perfection to conſiſt in all, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all, and yet before hauing aſcribed it to one, and namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to charitie. The third is ridiculous, and a meere dotage, albeit taken from ſome of the ancient Fathers, that too much doted vpon the excellencie of ſingle life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mariage. For <hi>Ierome</hi> (too farre gone that way) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth thoſe degrees of good fruit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good ground,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 23.</note> as <hi>Haymo</hi> doth theſe three adiuncts of the will of God.

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:210:111"/>
               <p>For my part therefore, I cannot but thinke them to be ſpoken partly by oppoſition in ſome ſort to the will of God before in the time of the Law; partly by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therewith, and preferment aboue it.</p>
               <p>By oppoſition, as he doth elſewhere call the miniſterie<note place="margin">2.

               <p>By compariſon alſo of the will of God in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament with his will in the old, I take theſe three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts to be vnderſtood, namely, <hi>good</hi> to ſignifie <hi>better, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> or <hi>well pleaſing</hi> to ſignifie <hi>more acceptable;</hi> or <hi>more pleaſing:</hi> &amp; <hi>perfect</hi> to ſignifie <hi>more perfect.</hi> Theſe things ſhal be more euident, by handling theſe adiuncts particularly.</p>

                  <hi>mouth.</hi> The Papiſts themſelues are much more skilfull in the tongues, and euery way more learned, then they were when Poperie was at the higheſt. For all which their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they may thanke the Proteſtants, whoſe learning hath bin a whetſtone to prouoke them to the more ſtudie for the maintenance of their damnable hereſies and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of diuels: and yet notwithſtanding by all their learning, they haue not bin able neither ſhall be able to ſupport their ſaid hereſies and diuelliſh doctrines from falling more and more.</p>
               <p>In the chiefe time of Poperie, alas what poore, what pitiful learning was there? It was then a common prouerb, <hi>Graecum eſt, legi non poteſt:</hi> It is Greeke, it cannot be read. Now I do verily thinke, that in ſome one Colledge in Cambridge and Oxenford, there are more good Grecians and Hebricians, then were 200 yeares ſince in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. That moſt reuerend learned man D. <hi>Fulke</hi> (the bane of Papiſts) being Maſter of Pembroke Hall in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, would ſometimes make the Fellows of that Houſe merry with the verſes that were made by ſome old Fellows and Maſters of Arts in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge, at the burning of <hi>Bucers</hi> bones. For there being a commandement from the Vice-chancellor then being, that all Maſters of Art ſhould make verſes againſt <hi>Bucer,</hi> ſome Fellowes of that Houſe were much troubled therewith, and did much murmure amongſt themſelues, and complained one to an other. Some of them opening their griefe to the Tutor of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:210:118"/> D. <hi>Fulke,</hi> then a yong and new Student in that Houſe; his ſaid Tutor ſaid vnto them: <hi>Why Sirs, I will tell you what ye ſhall do; I haue a yong ſcholler that is very pregnant and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in verſifying; make you verſes therefore as well as ye can, bring them to me, and my ſcholler ſhall correct them.</hi> So they made verſes as well as they could, and brought them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to his Tutor, who gaue them to his ſcholler to be corrected by him, who alſo kept them by him. But ſuch ſtuffe, as (according to the common ſpeech) would make a horſe to breake his halter to heare them. Whiles I was in Cambridge, being then ſomewhat familiar with one of the Fellowes of that Houſe, yet liuing, and a great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, and one of the chiefe Biſhops in the Land, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meeting together, he would make vs all ſport by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ſome of the verſes, as D. <hi>Fulke</hi> had made him and other Fellowes of that Houſe merry with them in their meetings. I confeſſe my fault in my great forgetfulneſſe of them as well as of better things. One Pentameter verſe I do onely remember, which is this,</p>
               <q>Crematur anima, cremetúrque corpus.</q>
               <p>Is it not a ſweete one? I could laugh my ſelfe, as old as I am, as heauie laden with many afflictions as I am, but that theſe times call vs rather to mourning and prayers. <hi>Lachrymae &amp; preces ſunt arma Eccleſiae:</hi> Prayers and teares are the weapons of the Church; neuer more needing them then now it doth, in ſo many places lying a bleeding as it doth. But equiuocation, truce-breaking, trecherie and treaſon, crueltie and murder (euen of Princes) are the weapons of the Romiſh ſynagogue. Therefore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſynagogue is not the Church.</p>
               <p>To returne; I may adde to the former the gift of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, inuented about the time of breaking forth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell out of the darkneſſe of Poperie, neuer before heard of; and the time ſince the beginning hereof is not yet 200 yeares: notwithſtanding this, by whom ſoeuer firſt inuented, the Lord hath graciouſly vſed as his Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſeman for carying of his Goſpell into all countries,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:210:118"/> and for the better propagation thereof; as alſo for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther battering down of that Romiſh myſterie of iniquitie.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this briefly is firſt to teach vs, if we wil haue our ſelues, thoughts, affections, words and works to pleaſe God, then repaire to this wil of God, and thereof to learne ſo to be, and ſo to do for matter and maner. If we reiect or neglect this will, neither ſhall our perſons euer pleaſe him, nor our thoughts, affections, words or actions be any delight vnto him. For this adiunct is here giuen to this will of God, by the way of excellencie and ſingularitie, as belonging onely to this will, and as noting that no mans or Angels will can bring our perſons into fauour with God, or make our thoughts, affections, words or works well pleaſing vnto him. Yea, the more we attend and apply our ſelues to the will of any other, not agreeing<note place="margin">Iſay. 29. 13.</note> to this will, the more we offend and diſpleaſe God. But hereof ſomewhat hath bin ſaid before. The ſame is to be ſaid of other belonging vnto vs, to do what lieth in vs for the prouoking of them to ſuch due regard of the will of God, as whereby they alſo may be made acceptable and well pleaſing to God, as this will of God it ſelfe is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the more that God acquainteth and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs with this his well pleaſing will, the more thankfull let vs be vnto him in that behalfe, and labour alſo the more to pleaſe him according thereunto. Thus much of the ſecond adiunct of this will of God in this place.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the third adiunct of this will of God, viz. perfect.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe third and laſt adiunct of the will of God now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,<note place="margin">Perfect.</note> namely, that it is here ſaid to be <hi>perfect.</hi> This alſo I vnderſtand oppoſitiuely and comparatiuely. Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiuely, becauſe the old Teſtament was imperfect: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiuely,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:210:119"/> becauſe this therefore is more perfect; yea moſt perfect, compleate and abſolute. If it be obiected,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7.</note> that the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The law</hi> (or doctrine) <hi>of the Lord is perfect,</hi> long before Chriſt came; and the Goſpell was giuen and written, as now we haue it. Yea, if it be further obiected, that that which before I ſaid, that the wil of God was before imperfect, and that now it is more perfect then before, implieth a contradiction, becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue argueth a poſitiue, and more perfect now, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth a perfect more. I anſwer to the ſecond obiection firſt, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comparatiue doth not always argue a poſitue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth one thing more perfect then another, argue the other therefore to be perfect. This is plaine by diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Scripture. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the wil</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>of God be ſo, that ye ſuffer for well doing then for euill doing;</hi> he doth not therefore argue, that it is good to ſuffer for euill doing; but onely meaneth that it is not all good, but euill to ſuffer for euill doing. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is better</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>to marrie then to burne;</hi> doth he meane, that it is therefore good to burne? When the Prophet ſaith, <hi>It is better to truſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 118. 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Lord, then to put confidence in man: it is better to truſt in the Lord, then to put confidence in Princes:</hi> doth he meane that it is therefore good to put confidence in man, or in Princes? I trow not. For another Prophet ſaith, <hi>Curſedis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the man that truſteth in man, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching that place, <hi>The law</hi> (or doctrine) <hi>of the law is perfect;</hi> and for further anſwer of both the branches of the former obiections: a thing may be perfect in diuers reſpects; and firſt in reſpect of time or ages. That may be perfect for one time and age, that is not for another. As for example, a horne-booke (as we call it) may be perfect, and haue all that is needfull for a yong child: and a Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for him afterward, when he is growne of more ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and after that he can reade Engliſh, then an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the principles of Grammar: which books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not all things fit to be learned when he is elder. So is it touching this matter. The Church of God before the<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 1. 4. &amp;c.</note>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:210:119"/> coming of Chriſt, was as it were in her nonage, vnder age, in her childhood, and not capable of all doctrine; and therefore the Lord dealt accordingly, and gaue her onely ſuch rudiments and principles as were fit for her, yea alſo ſufficient for her in that conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, accompanying the ſame with ſuch other matters, as it were gay things, as whereby ſhe might be the better pleaſed, and the more allured to learne ſuch things as were then taught. Therefore as there were ſacrifices and other ceremonies; ſo alſo the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle firſt, and afterward the Temple, were adorned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of ſiluer &amp; gold; though alſo therein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord had a further reach &amp; drift, then onely to allure them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to worſhip him in that maner that then he preſcribed; euen to foreſhew the beautie and glorie of his Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, eſpecially in heauen; and in the meane time how glorious inwardly all ſhould be, that are members of his ſpirituall temple here in this world.</p>
               <p>And in reſpect of the diuers ages in grace, and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men now for knowledge of the myſteries of this will of God, all is not to be taught all men, nor at all times. This our Sauiour teacheth, ſaying, <hi>No man putteth a peece</hi>

                  <hi>of new cloth in an old garment, &amp;c. neither do men put new wine into old veſſels, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>I haue many things yet</hi>

                  <hi>to ſay vnto you, but ye cannot beare them,</hi> that is, ye are not capable of them. Doth not the Apoſtle teach the very ſame, when he ſaith, <hi>And I brethren could not ſpeake vnto</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>you as vnto ſpirituall, but as vnto carnall, euen as vnto babes in Chriſt.</hi> The like is written to the Hebrewes. As it is in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 11.</note> for children of diuers ages and ſtatures, one is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for one, that is not enough for another: yea alſo in meates, according to the words of the Apoſtle: ſo is it touching this will of God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, for a more full anſwer of the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection; there is a double perfection. A perfection for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubſtance; and a perfection for circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the matter or ſubſtance. Let me illuſtrate this by a ſimilitude. Two men bargaining together for land
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:210:120"/> or ſome other thing, either vpon ſale or vpon deed, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together vpon the ſubſtance thereof, and couenants and conditions thereto belonging, do paſſe their word one to another, yea alſo before witneſſes for performance of the ſaid bargaine: it may be alſo they ſet downe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing briefly in writing, the better to teſtifie the ſame: notwithſtanding they reſerue and deferre the making and ſealing of deeds or indentures or bonds till another time, for the perfecting thereof in ſuch forme as whereby it may be the more firme for euer afterward. Such a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſo at the firſt made, is ſound and good for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof: but as touching the maner and forme, and other complements, it is not throughly perfect, till deeds or indentures, or bonds be drawne in forme of law, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſealed, and deliuered before witneſſes. As it is thus betwixt man and man, ſo is it touching the will of God betwixt God and man. His will in ſubſtance was perfect in <hi>Dauids</hi> time, yea in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Abraham;</hi> yea of <hi>Adam,</hi> immediatly after his fall, when this promiſe was<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> made, <hi>I wil put enmity between thee &amp; the woman, &amp; between her ſeed and thy ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> Theſe words were indeed ſpoken to the Serpent, but belonged to the woman, yea alſo to the man, and to the poſteritie of both. They containe two parts: a commination to the Serpent, that the ſeed of the woman (<hi>Chriſt</hi>) ſhould breake the head of the Serpent, that is, ſhould vtterly ſubdue the diuell and all his power; which notwithſtanding was a promiſe to the woman and to her ſeed. The ſecond part of the ſaid ſpeech of God, was a prophecie and a foretelling that the ſerpent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that had abuſed the viſible ſerpent in deceiuing of the woman, ſhould not for all that leaue his malice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:210:120"/> although this will of God were in ſubſtance perfect at the firſt; yet it being onely in promiſe, and a matter of great importance required a long time for the making of all writings, and the ſealing of them, with other matters belonging to the performance and full accompliſhment of the ſaid will. The writings were begun to be made, or rather drawne by <hi>Moſes</hi> at the direction of God himſelfe: after <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Lord from time vſed other clarks (as it were) and ſecretaries to write more, not in ſubſtance, but for the better explaning of thoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> had written, and that as occaſion required in reſpect of times and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, till the comming of Chriſt. When Chriſt was come, then firſt of all himſelfe in his owne perſon more fully<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 16. 2. Pet. 1. 21.</note> opened the former writings written by the inſpiration of God, and as the holy Ghoſt had moued holy men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to write. After Chriſt, the Apoſtles hauing plentifully receiued the holy Ghoſt, wrote all things done and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by our Sauiour, that were neceſſarie for vs to beleeue vnto ſaluation. Much alſo of that that <hi>Moſes</hi> had written being written to continue but for a time, euen til the death of Chriſt, was by the death of Chriſt cancelled, as being performed and accompliſhed, and all neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to remain without any alteration, was ſealed with the blood of Chriſt, as with the Lords broade ſeale of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Lord would haue all that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled<note place="margin">Why the Lord would haue the law being abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for all that vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the time of the Goſpell.</note> by Chriſt, to remaine vpon record for all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; not to be obſerued as it had bin, but to the end that thereby it might be the more euident, how all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed, foretold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſet forth by types, figures and ſhadowes, were accompliſhed, that ſo alſo men liuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell, might the better ſee their great preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues aboue them that liued vnder the Law, and in the time of the old Teſtament. The abrogating therefore of the old Teſtament, ſo farre as it was old and to be abrogated, doth not any way fauour thoſe that fondly think the Scriptures of the old Teſtament no way to belong vnto vs now.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:210:121"/> For how ſhall we ſee the truth of that that the Apoſtle<note place="margin">Act. 26. 22.</note> ſaith, <hi>he had ſaid no other things then thoſe which Moſes and the Prophets had ſaid ſhould come;</hi> and that <hi>the Goſpell was</hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding the old and new Teſtament do herein differ: firſt, that all things before promiſed, are in the New performed.

All things indeed by the Lord promiſed, are as certaine in reſpect of God as if they were performed: but they are not ſo perfect vnto vs, in reſpect of our weakneſſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> was aſſured of the kingdome of<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>To proceed yet further, this laſt will and teſtament of God is more perfect then the former, not onely in the former reſpects of performing all things before promiſed and ſignified by types, &amp;c. of remouing ſuch types and figures, as before did obſcure his will, and of the more
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:210:121"/> clearing of the ſubſtance it ſelfe of his wil, by our Sauiour and by his Apoſtles, but alſo becauſe now in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken by his Sonne, both immediatly in the perſon of his Sonne made man, and alſo mediatly in<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2. 2. Cor. 13. 3.</note> his Apoſtles, that he will neuer ſpeake any more by any man in ſuch maner, as that the word of any man ſhall be accounted the word of God, as heretofore the word of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other Prophets, and the Apoſtles hath bin accounted, and is to be accounted the word of God, and for the rule of any mans faith or life, any otherwiſe then it agreeth with his word written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Before the comming of Chriſt, God raiſed vp diuers Prophets, Prophet after Prophet, the latter to expound and interprete (as it were) the former; giuing leſſon vpon leſſon, <hi>line vpon line, line vpon line, now a little and then a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſay. 28. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>little.</hi> So likewiſe he directed the Apoſtles to write diuers Epiſtles to diuers Churches, ſome alſo to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: all which, and euery part whereof is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and receiued as <hi>giuen by inſpiration of God,</hi> and therfore<note place="margin">2.

Oh what an euidence is this of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the new will and teſtament of God aboue the old? No booke of the old Teſtament was ſo ſingularly the will of God, but that other bookes after written were as well to be accounted of: neither the whole old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo, but that the New was likewiſe: neither any part of the new written before the other ſo, but that the other written afterward, was of equall authoritie with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:210:122"/> So may it not be ſaid of any other bookes written ſince by any other whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, this word <hi>perfect,</hi> doth not onely import ſuch a will and teſtament, as whereto there ſhall neuer be any thing added as it were a codicill to be thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, but alſo ſuch a will and teſtament as ſhall continue for euer to the end of the world, and neuer be aboliſhed or abrogated in the whole or in any part thereof, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was: and this the word here vſed and tranſlated <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> in the Greeke and Latin tongue ſeemeth to import. Then is a thing ſaid to be perfected in Latin, when it is finiſhed and brought to the end. It is as plaine in the Greeke, becauſe the ſubſtantiue of the adiectiue here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſignifieth the end; and the aduerb deriued from both, ſignifieth to the end: as when it is ſaid, <hi>Hope perfectly,</hi> the<note place="margin">1.

For the laſt will and teſtament of a man cannot be altered after the death of the teſtator: ſo cannot the will and teſtament of God, made by his Sonne, in the name of God, and by the authoritie of God, be now alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the Sonne that made it being now dead, and his will being proued in the great and high Court of heauen by God himſelfe the Iudge of all the world, from whom there is no appeale to any other. <hi>Where a teſtament is</hi> (ſaith<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 16.</note> the Apoſtle) <hi>there muſt alſo be the death of the teſtator: for a teſtament is of force after men are dead; otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all whiles the teſtator liueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be obiected, that albeit Chriſt died, yet he now <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth</hi>

For that his once death, though raiſed againe, was more then if all the men in the world, yea alſo if all the Angels in heauen had died, neuer to be againe reſtored to life. And by that his death he hath freed all his elect from euerlaſting death moſt iuſtly deſerued by them.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:210:122"/> Againe, though he now liue in heauen, yet he is ſo dead vnto men, as that he ſhall neuer againe liue with men in this world, to eate and drinke, to be hungrie and thirſtie, and wearie in his owne perſon as he was.</p>

               <p>I might likewiſe here ſpeake of the contempt of the<note place="margin">Reprehenſion of ſome among vs.</note> word amongſt our ſelues; yea, by them that would not be accounted profane perſons as <hi>Eſau,</hi> but profeſſors, and ſuch as will ſhew faire countenances to Miniſters and to other that do indeed regard the word.

If the word be preached to ſome in the morning, ſomewhat ſooner then other men preach; or in the afternoone ſomewhat later then other men, though vpon neuer ſo good reaſon, yea vpon ſome neceſſitie; oh then it is preached out of ſeaſon.

The Fathers that liued vnder the old Teſtament, mentioned in the beginning of the firſt Chapter to the Hebrewes. The rather muſt we labour ſo as before we ſaid, to apply our ſelues wholy to the things we haue heard out of this will, more abundantly then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſaid Fathers did; becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe Prophets by whom God had in old time ſo ſpoken to thoſe Fathers, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in that firſt verſe of the firſt Chapter to the Hebrewes; becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> (I ſay)<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Concerning therefore the former of thoſe two, the more excellent that thoſe three adiuncts before handled<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie.</note> do ſhew the will of God to be, the more excellent alſo muſt needs be the calling of them whom the Lord hath made Miniſters of the ſaid will: as his ſpirituall Lawyers indeed to declare the ſaid his will vnto his people, and to lay forth and (as it were) to pleade all his bountifull and moſt princely legacies therein bequeathed vnto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the enemies of their ſaluation, that endeuour what they can to depriue them of the ſaid legacies. The more excellent (I ſay) that by thoſe adiuncts of this will the Miniſters thereof are, then were the Miniſters of his former will, now by this his laſt will (in part) reuoked and diſanulled, they more highly muſt they be accounted. For, as the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes proueth Chriſt the<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3. 13. 20 1. Pet. 5. 4.

We are not ſo much to reſpect the gifts of men, as Gods ordinance, both in ſetting able Miniſters ouer vs, and alſo in commanding reſt on his day.

               <p>For who will alſo to take libertie to go on that day whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they liſt, to whom they liſt, is to breake the heart of ſuch forſaken Miniſters, and to make the gifts which ſuch high ſpirited men in conceit of their owne great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thinke but weake, to be much weaker; and ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, as that they ſhall not preach to other as they ought and otherwiſe would; at leaſt that they cannot do their worke <hi>with ioy but with griefe,</hi> and to the leſſe profit<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> of their hearers.

               <p>Touching gifts, many ſuch conceited men do greatly erre in their iudgements of mens miniſteriall gifts.

Oh <hi>the heart of man</hi> herein <hi>is deceitfull aboue all things,</hi> and is as eaſily puft vp, as any other way corrupted. As God alſo giueth not alwayes the greareſt bleſſing to the greateſt fare for the bodie, but ſometimes maketh men to proſper as well with courſe cheare as with the diet of Princes or Nobles, (as appeareth by <hi>Daniel</hi> and<note place="margin">Dan. 1. 8.</note> his companions, and daily by many poore mens childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that being hardly brought vp, looke as well, and are as comely and beautifull as the children of other that are moſt daintily fed;) ſo alſo the Lord ſometimes bleſſeth the meane gifts of ſome (that are eſpecially accounted meane) to as good edifying of other in the faith, as the greateſt gifts that are. Daily experience teacheth this. The worthieſt Miniſters for learning, paines and godlineſſe, haue not alwayes the moſt and beſt Chriſtian congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>But touching the hearing of our owne Miniſters; what if the Pariſh be ſo ſpacious, that the inhabitants thereof dwell three, foure, fiue or ſix miles from their own Church (as ſome Pariſhes in ſome parts of the kingdome are) and that the word be preached nearer, as ſome people go by the Churchyards of other Pariſhes, that go much farther to their owne Church; what I ſay is to be done in ſuch a caſe? I anſwer, that in ſuch a caſe, there is better warrant for the father trauell on the Lords day, becauſe of Gods prouidence in ſo diſpoſing of Pariſhes in former times, and thereby making a kind of neceſſitie of ſuch trauelling. Againe, in ſuch a caſe I do in charitie ſuppoſe that a mans owne Miniſter will not be againſt his going to the nearer Preacher, ſo that it be without contempt of him; and that when he may he do heare him, not defrauding him of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other dutie. I hope alſo that none of our wiſe Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall gouerners being acquainted herewith, would diſlike of this that I ſay; but would eaſily grant any reaſonable libertie to ſuch as ſo do dwell. For concluſion of this point, let me ſpeake a litle more to ſuch Miniſters as are ſo forſaken and diſcouraged: in good earneſt therefore, and in the words of ſobrietie I exhort them to comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and that firſt of all in their aſſurance of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the Lord, who beholding all their diſgrace with men, will in the end giue them the more honour and glorie.

What good Miniſter is there that watcheth not in bodie as well as minde for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed vnto him? yea, many a time doth he wake in the night, meditating what to ſpeake, when other ſleep ſoundly. The labour alſo of the minde is greater then of the bodie. How great then is the labour of both? Two houres labour of the Miniſter in preaching, doth more ſpend his ſpirits and waſte his bodie, then two dayes labor in any other bodily worke. Doth the ſpirits and bodie of one ſo ſoke men? Therefore the calling of a Miniſter is compared to the greateſt bodily labours that are; of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 40. Luk. 2. 8, Mat. 9. 36. 1.

Yea, ſome men of great ſort ſpend more in one yeare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dogs, haukes, horſes, tobacco, and the like, then in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares vpon the Miniſters of the word.

Yet ſome, whatſoeuer they heare or ſee, by their apparel, by their debt to other, or any otherwayes, wil neuer beleeue they want, till either for debt they be clapt vp in priſon, or ſtarue for hunger.

                  <note place="margin">Rom 16. 23.</note> did ſo write. If there be one ſuch in a whole towne, all the reſt of profeſſors, though richer then that one, will giue him leaue to beare the whole burden alone; yea alſo laugh ſometimes in their ſleeues ſecretly for his ſo doing. Though diuers Preachers come to a towne, and one of them do beſtow his labours amongſt them; all will giue one leaue to inuite the Preacher and the reſt: or elſe they muſt go to ſome Inne, and dine at their owne charge. Should it be ſo? Let ſuch take heed they find not as cold entertainment, where they would haue and looke for the beſt.

                  <note place="margin">Mala. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>filled the Lords altaer with teares, with weepings and cryings out?</hi> and will he put vp the ſighings and gronings of his Miniſters, by ſuch hard and wretched dealings towards them? Some hearing them complaine of want, will bid them be of good cheare, and comfort themſelues as they haue comforted other; the Lord wil prouide for them, &amp;c. but in the meane time themſelues though neuer ſo able, will do nothing. Theſe indeed are wordy comforters, and ſuch <hi>phyſitians of no worth or value,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> calleth his friends.<note place="margin">Iob. 13. 4.

God comfort them more by his word for the time to come, then they for the time paſt by their workes haue comforted ſuch Miniſters; yea, or then themſelues yet haue for their owne ſoules. Some perhaps will obiect, that ſome Miniſters are rich of themſelues, and haue enough of their owne. So indeed ſome thinke, though they ſee the contrary. And ſo ſome thinke, if a Miniſter haue neuer ſo litle. Euery thing is thought too much for him; though ſuch ſpeakers thinke nothing enough for themſelues. And what if a Miniſter be rich of himſelfe? is that enough to excuſe ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudgers<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> from <hi>making him partaker of all his goods?</hi> Doth the Apoſtle giue the former commandement with any ſuch condition? Let ſuch a one ſay ſo to his tailer, to him that hath ſowne his ground for him, &amp;c. coming for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for his worke, will it be taken at his hand to tell him, what, you need not any mony, you are rich of your ſelfe? The ſame might the Corinthians haue obiected to <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he ſaith that he <hi>robbed other Churches, and tooke</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>wages of them to do ſeruice vnto the Corinthians:</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may ſome Miniſters ſay in theſe dayes, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:210:137"/> kindneſſe of other, to do good to them that regard them not. But was not that of <hi>Paul</hi> a commendation to the Corinthians? No: he rather obiected it as a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace vnto them, and a reprehenſion of them. So is the like to all other that do the like.</p>
               <p>Is it not alſo a ſhame that Ieſuites and other Popiſh Prieſts ſhould be bountifully maintained by the Papiſts within our land, and diuers painfull Miniſters ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as they are by profeſſors of the Goſpell?

But now, that perhaps of the Apoſtle for Miniſters to be <hi>hoſpitall,</hi> is thought to be, that they ſhould be put into ſome hoſpitall, there to liue with other poore men.

                  <hi>or ſiluer, &amp;c.</hi> do not at all infringe, but much confirme this maintenance of Miniſters of this will of God that I pleade for, becauſe by confirming the ſaid words by theſe, <hi>For the labourer is worthy of his meate,</hi> that is, of all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for this life, euen abundantly according to his calling; thoſe words (I ſay) of confirmation do plainly ſhew, that the Preachers of the word ſhould altogether be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them to whom they preach; and that that they haue of their owne, to beſtow it otherwiſe, as themſelues ſhall thinke good.</p>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:210:139"/> in the former firſt verſe, I ſee no neceſſitie of interpreting it otherwiſe, but great reaſon to take it as before, euen for Miniſters of the word eſpecially, as in that place to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie;</hi> and the word <hi>yongers</hi> to ſignifie the whole flock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. As the word <hi>Elders</hi> is vſed for Miniſters, to teach all Miniſters, of what age ſoeuer, to be graue and ſober in all their cariage and conuerſation, as elders in yeares ought to be: ſo why may not the word <hi>yongers</hi> be<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 2.</note> taken for the whole flocke, of what age ſoeuer, to teach them to carie themſelues towards the Miniſters, as they that are yongers in yeares ought to do towards their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? There is the more reaſon thereof, becauſe all to be taught in the word are often in the ſame reſpect called by the name of <hi>children,</hi> that they may as willingly obey their<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 11.

               <p>But to returne to the point of obedience now in hand, the Apoſtle in the former place to the Hebrewes is very expreſſe in that behalfe, confirming it from the end (as hath bin ſhewed) namely, that <hi>elders</hi> there ſaid to haue the ruling or guiding of them, may giue the more comfortable account, and with ioy and without griefe diſcharge their dutie to them ouer whom they are ſet, becauſe it is vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable that it ſhould be done with griefe.</p>

Let them neither ad any thing thereto, nor detract any thing there from, leſt ſo of the will of God, they make the will of man. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how foule a thing were it ſo to deale with the will of<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2.</note> a man? Let them preach it in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. The great ignorance, and the like impietie of the people every where requireth it ſo to be. Yet alas, how great is the negligence of the Miniſters herein? I haue ſpoken ſomewhat hereof before. But who can ſpeake enough to cure this diſeaſe, againſt which ſo many of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo many of our owne, (all moſt worthy men) haue written ſo much, ſo divinely, ſo learnedly, ſo fully and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially? and yet no reformation, either of Non reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or of the idlenes of them that are reſident. Verely this is the ſtaine and the blame of many Churches. This is the the bane of many ſoules: ſo much worſe then the murder<note place="margin">Ezech. 3. 18. &amp; 33. 6. Act 20. 26. 27.</note> of ſo many bodyes, by how much the ſoule is better then the body. And yet the death of the ſoule is alſo the death of the body for ever in the world to come. The body may here be killed; and yet the ſoule liue: yea, ſoule and body may liue forever in heaven. But if the ſoule be here mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, both ſoule and body cannot but be caſt into hell, <hi>where their worme dyeth not, and the fire ſhall never be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</hi>

               <p>The negligence alſo of the Miniſters: in diſcharge of their office, is the cauſe likewiſe of all outward evills and calamities to the people. But this ſore requyreth the help of our governours, for the cure thereof by their authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without it all ſpeaking, all preaching, all writting will doe no good. The more this evill hath hitherto ben ſpoken, preached, and written againſt, the more it hath increaſed, and dayly doth increaſe. Let vs therefore the more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray the Lord to incline the heart of our dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: and of out other Rulers vnder his Maieſtie, to put to their helping hands, for redreſſe and Reformation thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus much of theſe two verſes, and of this Argument<note place="margin">The concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atiſe.</note> of the Chriſtian Sacrifice.
